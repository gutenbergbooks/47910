<h3>I</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>August, 1916</i></p>

<p>I am thirty this day, the twenty-ninth of August, 1916.
The guns are roaring along the Somme front. Another
great attack is on. The gray waves are passing over the
top for the thousandth time and, for the thousandth time,
hope is in the air once more. I feel it in the sudden
optimism of the daily bulletin, in the groups in the market-place,
in the little knot of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">evacués</i>, here in a Savoyard
courtyard, basking in the sun and studying the winding
line of pins on the yellowed map of the front.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>Brigadier David Littledale, Légion Etrangère, Croix
de Guerre, wounded at Verdun, March 5th, shell
wound in the shoulder and the leg, shell-shock and
gangrene. Entered Val de Grace, March 21st, evacuated
on Chambèry, July 10th, 1916.</i>”</p></blockquote>

<p>The record used to hang at the foot of my bed beside
the fever chart and the record of operations. From
Chambèry, here into a rest area, to put on flesh again,
to quiet my jumping nerves and to fatten up for the
return to the front. To-day I have no desire to hasten
that return. I write it down frankly,&mdash;as I intend to
keep honesty with myself and my impressions. There
are other times when I feel the tug and fret to be back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
It is my mood to-day, as war is a succession of unrelated
moods.</p>

<p>This morning I ask no more of life than to continue
here at my open window in the buzzing month of August,
looking down on a drowsy world in animal content. A
pipe of tobacco and the noonday meal&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pinard</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pommes
de terre frites</i>, and perhaps a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ragout</i> with a touch of
onions&mdash;all these simple joys to my keen senses seem
the limit of human desires.</p>

<p>There is a touch of ivy at my window; below, the
courtyard is flagged and the red-tiled, shovel-hatted Savoyard
roofs throw sharp blue shadows across the glowing
yellow pavement. Bompard, an old territorial, is
peeling potatoes in the door frame. Coustic and Valentin,
of the Chasseurs Alpins, are quarreling good-humoredly
over a game of Manille, and old Canache, of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bat d’Af</i>, is baking in the chaise-longue, kepi over
his nose, and a thin stream of smoke twining upward like
Jack’s beanstalk. A mottled setter is flat on his side;
a kitten plays with its toes; over the pink roofs the Col
du Chat strikes into the skies with its brass cross blazing
in the sun, and I say to myself, incredulously, that on
the Northern Front cannon are roaring, men pitting themselves
against machines, as the long trains of wounded
begin to move our way,&mdash;into one of which at some
near day I shall step and return to the Legion.</p>

<p>A buxom, tow-headed girl comes clattering into the
courtyard, draws a pail of water and moves sinuously
out. An exchange of jests, and we watch her go. She
is more than a woman. She is woman. She represents
that incredible other life to us, the dream life that runs
at night with the will-o’-the-wisps along the trenches;
violins and dancing under southern harvests; wet beaches
and a glowing Normandy hearth; lights on the boulevards;
children’s voices; an old couple waiting on a doorstep,&mdash;many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
things to many men! To me it brings
back a stranger of four years and some months ago,&mdash;David
Littledale, of Littledale, Connecticut; an old,
rambling, red-sided house under the elms; a household
of young people, frolicking; a girl’s face,&mdash;a first love;
Ben, Alan, and Rossie, and one tomboy, shock-haired
sister, Molly, galloping up the avenue on Pinto, the cow
pony.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Will I ever go back to it and, if I do, will all this pass
away like the frantic shadow that blots out the valley
when thunder clouds come stampeding down the Col du
Chat? Will the old life come out again, as the countryside
returns, brilliant and glistening, sunlight and
shadow, balanced and friendly? Is war an incident, or
an education that remains? To tell the truth, I have
seldom thought on such things,&mdash;never in the line of
duty.</p>

<p>In resigning my will I am conscious of having resigned
my imagination. The future is so indecipherable
that it is rather a relief to say to one’s self:</p>

<p>“Nothing that I can do, say or think, except obey
orders, can have the slightest effect on what is fated to
happen.”</p>

<p>After two years war ceases to be an experience: it becomes
a journey to be traveled in the shafts of the inevitable.
I have gone through it, inspired, thrilled,
grumbling, skeptical, rebellious, joking mechanically,
but always, at the last test, obedient to the hidden power
in the machine that decides my every act.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Why have I fallen back on this introspective mood in
these emerging days of convalescence? I think it is as
a refuge from the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cafard</i>,&mdash;a feeling of after all being
a stranger in a strange land. Perhaps it has a basis in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
physical weakness,&mdash;perhaps simply inaction: inaction
which is so demoralizing. To-day I have a longing to be
back&mdash;to rub elbows with my own people&mdash;to be no
longer “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’Americain</i>” but an American among Americans.</p>

<p>For there is always this difference between me and
Coustic and Valentin, sons of the mountain side; Canache,
Apache and filcher of the gutters; Bompard, tiller
of Normand soil: they are fighting for something bigger
than themselves that at times raises them to heights
of heroic eloquence, that obliterates the present and joins
them to their forbears of the brave days of old: Grognards,
Sans Culottes, Chevaliers and bearded Gauls.
While I, I am fighting alone, for love of a man’s adventure,
in order to find myself. I am alone, for, much
as I love their country, it is theirs,&mdash;not mine.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Yet, if I cannot entirely possess this deep spirit of
nationalism, it has been the most satisfying experience
of my haphazard, drifting life to live among those who
did. You cannot understand the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i> with your ears
alone.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Blagueur</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">critique</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sceptique</i> (bluffer, critic and skeptic)&mdash;I
have lived two years with them, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i> myself
by the grace of rags and dirt, by a thousand sworn oaths
never to move a further inch. I have sung with them in
the slimy trenches of the first winter. I have cursed their
commanders and sat on their boards of strategy. I have
doubted, rebelled, grumbled, and denied my leader and,&mdash;at
the zero hour, surged up and gone over the top.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I went into the war, heaven knows, wearied of my
kind and of myself, disillusioned with man, seeking
men. I have found what I sought. I have found and
I understand them,&mdash;men, the mass, the race, which
moves on, slowly, irresistibly, without inner questionings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
doing what must be done. Above all, I have known the
love of the Fatherland, the faith of the humble, handed
down at simple hearths,&mdash;the will to remain, whatever
the cost, French. Well, if I am fated to lie in No-man’s-land,
I am honestly thankful to have known life at its
simplest, its keenest, and to have served some purpose.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Blagueur</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">critique</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sceptique</i>, but, at the call of duty,&mdash;ready.
Often have I marveled at the soul of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i>, the bit of sunlight that abides in it&mdash;the love
of the beautiful&mdash;the answering thrill when a hero
leads; that inexhaustible reserve, at the bottom of which
miracles wait! Yesterday the answer came, and it
illumined the dark places.</p>

<p>At lunch we were discussing the prospects of going
back, that and the end of the war are, of course, the daily
topics. Canache launched on his favorite tirade against
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">embusqués</i>; Paris was full of them; the hospitals
were full of them; twenty miles behind the front they
were as thick as berries; before they sent back the older
classes who had been shot to pieces once already, let them
clean out the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">embusqués</i>! As for him, Canache, he would
refuse to go,&mdash;like that, flat! He’d demand justice; he’d
tell a few names, and he ended by spitting contemptuously
on the flagging, and exclaiming:</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sale Gouvernement!</i>”</p>

<p>Coustic, who wore the Military Medal and the Croix
de Guerre, humored the old rogue, knowing well the heart
of iron behind the froth. But, as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i>, he would have
been a traitor to his kind not to grumble. For the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i>
has a fixed attitude: everything is wrong, from top to
bottom: the government, the leaders; the commissariat,
especially; the civilians, always. And, always, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i>,
despite injustice, favoritism, neglect and inefficiency, is
there to save the day! Valentin wagged his head wisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
and swore that every word was gospel. Bompard alone
remained mute, buried in his bread and cheese.</p>

<p>“Well, old grunter, what do you say to all this?” I
said, addressing him.</p>

<p>“Me?” Bompard’s face is the purple of the grape; he
has a long sweeping moustache and his eyes disappear
behind shaggy eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Yes, you. What’ll you do if you have to go back?”</p>

<p>“Bah! What’s the use of words,” he said contemptuously;
“if we have to go back, we’ll go. If we’ve
got to fight, we’ll fight. That’s all there is to it. We’ll
do our duty&mdash;the same as the others&mdash;perhaps, the
same, perhaps, a little better. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Que diable! Nous avons
du sang français dans nos artères, et le sang français
ne ment pas!</i>”</p>

<p>The revolt died. Canache’s eyes flashed. He was
back at the front, spitting Boches and swearing horribly.
Coustic and Valentin, ashamed to have been caught in a
cheap insincerity, sat up under the reproof, the good
red blood of France mounting to their cheeks. Bompard
had found the phrase. At that moment, had the hated
little town major stuck his head through the postern and
cried, “Volunteers, to go immediately to the front!” we
would have risen, as one man, and cried:</p>

<p>“Ready!”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>So our leaders talk to us who understand us. A phrase&mdash;something
to fire the imagination&mdash;something to exalt
the heart&mdash;something to throw defiantly from the
lips in the cauldron of battle&mdash;a phrase to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i> is
worth an army or ten thousand cannon!</p>

<p>It was with a phrase that we won at Verdun and rolled
the Hun back from the Marne.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mourir sur place! Debout les morts! Ils ne passeront
pas!</i>” The whole war is there. And to me who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
heard it, the phrase which fell unconsciously from old
Bompard’s lips,&mdash;“French blood never lies!” makes the
rest comprehensible.</p>

<p>It is something to have the right to a phrase like that.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>II</h3>

<p>Yesterday, when I began these notes, it was more as
a caprice than from any conviction that I would continue
them. Yet to-day, I find myself to my surprise filled with
a certain eagerness. During the night the thought came
to me that it would be interesting to attempt an absolutely
honest portrayal of myself, setting down everything,
small and great, the good and the bad, as it occurred.</p>

<p>A classmate I met at Harvard (I cannot remember his
name) once said to me, casually:</p>

<p>“The man who has the courage to write down day by
day the true record of his life, concealing nothing, excusing
nothing, without attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable,
putting down the sublime and the ridiculous, the
mud that soils his feet as he contemplates the stars, the
struggle, the inconsistencies, the little basenesses, the
hypocrisies that make him virtuous&mdash;the man who will
dare arraign himself before the pitiless bar of his own
judgment&mdash;will leave an immortal book. But no one
has ever confessed, and no one ever will.”</p>

<p>I never forgot this remark. It determined a whole
course of mental speculation, fortunately or unfortunately,
for it threw me into a period of introspection
which at times verged perilously close to a melancholia,
which might have been fatal had I not had in my sound
body the corrective of an intense animal delight in life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
and an abounding curiosity for adventure. Since then,
I have read copiously in the so-called confessions that
line the shelves of intimate libraries, and I have recognized
the essential truth of the dictum. Even Jacques
Casanova who, in the effrontery of his brilliant record
of a master-rogue, seems to have approached the stark
verity of a confession, has moments of colossal vanity,
in which he cannot resist the temptation to pose as an
honest man. As for the famous confessions of Jean
Jacques Rousseau, they confess nothing at all except
perhaps the author’s desire to pass as a great man.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It may be that a sentiment of vanity alone is the impulse
which has determined me to this attempt; yet I do
not think it is entirely that,&mdash;except as vanity is a natural
and healthy quality and is allied to ambition. What
is ambition? Is it not an instinctive rebellion against the
little term of existence which is accorded to us, the soul’s
struggling against mortality,&mdash;the longing to leave something
behind us so that we shall not be utterly snuffed
out?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Of such ambition I am conscious. If two years voyaging
over the stormy paths of war has left me with a
new conception of the flotsam value of my life against the
great currents of human destiny, it has robbed death of
half its terrors. Death has seemed such a casual thing.
Yet, at other times, there comes a swift, passionate revulsion
towards living,&mdash;a need of not entirely passing
out of the memory of those who have known us. This is
the explanation, I believe, of the multitude of little diaries,
often but a jumble of hasty notes jotted down on the eve
of an attack; an impression of incredulous delight after
deliverance out of the agony of battle; a last cry of the
soul, scribbled in a shell hole under the flaming winds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
a bombardment; a final struggling to leave something
that will remain,&mdash;something tangible beyond a memory
that recedes. It is this instinct, I think, which I obey.
We are all more or less fatalists; and I, for my part, feel
that my end will come in the moving ranks&mdash;some day&mdash;sooner
or later&mdash;but inevitably. There were those who
were certain they would pass unscathed out towards the
unimaginable dawn, who died at my side, by a grim freak
of fate that left me living. Yet my fatalism is unshaken.
I am neither sadder nor happier for it: I accept it as the
final explanation of my presence here.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Before estimating my past conduct or proceeding to a
critical analysis of the future, I may as well take stock
of Mr. David Littledale, as he stands to-day.</p>

<p>Physically the damage done is trifling and soon repaired.
The shoulder is as good as new. The leg will
carry a limp for some time to come. The effects of the
gas are rapidly departing, and in another two months my
nerves should come again under complete control.</p>

<p>Outwardly I am a typical Littledale, of a family of
fighting men and militant preachers. There never was
a Littledale who did not have three marked characteristics;
the straight bushy line of the eyebrows, the low
cropped hair over the forehead, and the mouth cut like
an inverted sickle. The stark ruggedness of the jaws of
our Puritan ancestry has been softened with easier generations
but the faces run lean and brown and muscled.
The ears are particularly my own and have a defiant way
of leaving the head that has earned a score of insulting
nicknames.</p>

<p>As a family we are not given to gayety, rather over-serious,
I am afraid; tenacious, introspective, seldom
shining in conversation, listeners rather than debaters,
realists and traditionalists,&mdash;though occasionally a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
dreamer, like my brother Alan, comes into the family,
rebels, breaks away, and disappears restlessly into the
outer world.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>To take stock of myself mentally is not so easy. I
have received the deplorable education of the day. Everything
that possibly could be done was done to make me
hate the pursuit of knowledge. I am, indeed, an excellent
example of the signal failure of American education,&mdash;the
failure to provide for the utilization of a
developed type. My father and my grandfather and his
father before him were brought up to public service as
the result of a system of society and education which demanded
service of them. What, all at once, has happened
to our generation? We had everything to make us
leaders, family traditions, unlimited opportunity and
undoubted energy; yet the only result that I can see
of our education has been either to divert our unquestioned
energy towards a heaping up of material comforts
or to make of us triflers and dilettanti; in a word,
parasites. It may have been our fault, but I think it was
deeper,&mdash;the fault of national thinking. Undoubtedly,
in the future, the irresistible forces which mold a nation
will bring order into the multiplicity of confused movements
which now dominate us. But as I look back, even
from my short retrospective, and see myself and my
brothers, I can give but one judgment. We are a generation
wasted.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I am at that point in my life when traditions fall away;
when a man, educated as I have been, suddenly finds
himself alone, wandering through a vast valley of doubt,
seeking, with the instinct that is in men for order, to recreate
in stone the house of cards which has just fallen
about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>What do I really believe? What of my education remains
after the test of experience? I was taught certain
principles of morality, certain judgments on conduct,
given certain standards of right and wrong. Virtue must
bring its own reward and the wages of sin is death.</p>

<p>After a few years’ contact with the world, I find myself
completely mystified. Perhaps I have been too often
behind the scenes and must pay the penalty of disillusionment.
I was given certain principles of common honesty,&mdash;and
I have seen great criminals exalted because they
either stole on a grandiose scale or procured others to
steal for them. True, I have heard many unflattering
judgments passed on these financiers, privately, but these
criticisms seemed to proceed more from an instinctive
envy, and I seldom found that they interfered in the least
with the successful rogue’s power in the community. I was
given certain sharp distinctions between good women
and bad. In the cosmopolitan society which I knew
in Paris, I saw those who were surest of their position
flagrantly and insolently defying all public criticism. I
have never found, in my occasional contact with women
of the demimonde, the libertinage that I have met with
in certain of the most exalted spheres of society.</p>

<p>My grandfather was Senator and a member of the
National Cabinet. My great-grandfather was one of the
founders of the nation. My father, as judge of the Circuit
Court, has been in intimate touch with public men
and party politics. The ideal of public leadership I
have always regarded reverently and yet, on closer contact,
I have discovered that the leaders who were like
demigods to my young imagination were capable of underhand
trafficking for office and midnight deals with repellant
political tricksters that seemed to me to place
them on a level with political fences,&mdash;receivers of
stolen political goods. Puritan I am and shall always be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
so long as the heart of a child, which abides in every man,
remains open. Yet I have been wandering along pagan
roads, seeking new readjustments, which do not satisfy
me, as I at first believed.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There may be a deeper truth than I have uncovered
below the shallow surface of my experience. There must
be, though I have not yet had the vision to perceive it,&mdash;unless
it be by renouncing the class into which I was born
and seeking new elements of faith in closer contact with
the great simple mass of humanity which remains vitally
significant and predestined, through the saving grace of
struggle.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Yet do I believe, whole-heartedly and without reservation,
in Democracy? I am not sure. Certainly, not in
the demoralization into which I see it now wandering. Not
if it means Democracy at the price of inefficiency, rejection
of self-discipline, and the negation of real leadership.
The vital principle, to me, is the equalization of
opportunity. Yet with it there must be an aristocracy of
achievement and an ability to recognize the quality of
leadership in exceptional men,&mdash;without which Democracy
is no better than a rabble.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>If I should announce such ideas in the rigid formalism
of my Littledale home, I would be regarded, I know, as
an intellectual pariah. But I am not seeking to impose
my ideas on others. I am setting them down in a moment
of intellectual luxury, for my own self-education;
that is, as I perceive them through this vista of isolation,
when old commonplaces come into a new significance.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>To-day there is a great yearning inside me, allied with
a new feeling of homesickness. I long to go to the home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
that is denied me. The air which I have breathed these
long two years has been extraordinarily vital. I have
lived with humanity at its keenest. With all the sodden
realism of war, with all its inconsistencies of detail, its
mingled brutality and heroism, it has been a privilege to
have known its rare moments of exaltation. I have
known my kind as they are, as my friends in the courtyard
below are,&mdash;inconsistent and frail, selfish, avaricious,
sunk in mere animal passions of living; but I have
seen a sudden flaming vision of sacrifice exalt them
above the brute, as I have known Christian and Pagan
to offer themselves on the cross of their own suffering that
their race might go on living.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>III</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>September</i></p>

<p><i>Sunday evening.</i></p>

<p>This morning I attended Mass with Coustic and Valentin,
who are very religious. (The others are not.) I
like the solemnity and the calm of the old Cathedral, the
footsteps that slip past lost in the obscurity, the candle-points
that punctuate the darkness without illuminating
it, the sense of repose, beauty, meditation. Yet, every
time I enter a church now and see the cross, my memory
returns to another crucifixion, to a man who was not
divine, yet who never flinched in his sacrificial agony.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>His name was Jules Fromentin, and a worse rascal did
not exist in the company. He had been a deserter in the
Argentine, but he had his code. And, somewhere in the
bottom of his muddied philosophy was the love of France.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
He caught the first steamer, claimed foreign citizenship,
and enlisted in the Legion. One night, in the spring of
1915, when we held the trenches at the foot of the Notre
Dame de Lorette slopes, working towards Ablain St. Nazaire,
a scouting detail was caught between the lines and
wiped out. Fromentin, alone, wounded to the death, was
left hanging on an advanced section of our barbed wire,
to which he had struggled. To attempt a rescue was
humanly impossible. We had made an advance the night
before, and another was expected. The Boches, on the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">qui vive</i>, kept the night luminous with rockets and drooping
flares. No head could have appeared for an instant
above the trench in the illuminated night. At that, only
the authority of our commander held us in. I can remember
still our feeling of horror and of rage as we crouched
helplessly in the whipped-around trench and listened with
the cold sweat starting up our backs. Fromentin was
singing,&mdash;a ribald marching song, an unprintable thing,
salacious and vilifying the Boches. From time to time
a bullet reached home. Then the song ceased, and a defiant
voice cried:</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Touché! Vive la France!</i>”</p>

<p>He lay there, suffering untold tortures&mdash;a man, and
not a god&mdash;without hope or faith, passing through the
sacrificial agony, and yet, hour after hour:</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Touché! Sales Boches! Vive la France!</i>”</p>

<p>Then, at dawn, a final bullet, more merciful than the
rest.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Touché!</i> Ah&mdash;” And silence.</p>

<p>When we got to him, two days later, there were twenty-two
bullet wounds in him.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I put it down reverently, and reverently I compare
that crucifixion that is a symbol of mankind dying for an
ideal with the divine agony on Calvary. The agony was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
equal but no certainty of Paradise opened before the
man, unless there came a glorified vision we could not
share. Often, in the drab weariness of war, the sodden
fatigue, the brutalizing of the instincts and the weakening
of the spirit, I go back to the lingering horror and
sublimity of that night and cling to my symbol. For me
every crude wooden cross that rises in the fields has this
human replica of the Calvary.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The strange thing, or perhaps the natural thing, is that
I have little inclination to write about the war. It is
rather myself in its past progression and the self which
has come out of the reaction of the war which interests
me.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>For the war is not a logical sequence in my memory.
It is a jumble and confusion of reiterated notes, endless
movement, hunger, drenching, cold. Only a few scenes
detach themselves,&mdash;a very few. When I recall the mobilization,
I hear only one voice in the surge and roar
of hysterical multitudes crowding down to the departing
trains at the Gare du Nord,&mdash;a child’s voice, saying:</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Non, non</i>, mamma,&mdash;don’t cry. Be brave,&mdash;till
he’s gone!”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I seldom remember definite details, any particular
dawn breaking after the night of vigil, or the shrinking
waiting of any one bombardment. It is all one stretching
gray line of sky; a tireless to and fro of men and horses;
the same broken line of trenches, a monotony of slime
and sleety rain; and all this is confused, as though I were
struggling upward through swirling, roaring bodies of
water. Repetition has dulled the perceptions. I am
conscious only of fatigue, of unending beating against
the ears, of vigils under stars that never sink, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
marching,&mdash;yes, here one vivid impression always returns.
It is one of those memories that enter into the
phantasmagoria of the night.</p>

<p>I am back again in the ranks, that have been marching
for days. Some one&mdash;the comrade at my left&mdash;says:</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon vieux?</i>”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“I want to sleep a little.”</p>

<p>“Pass over your rifle.”</p>

<p>Then he places his arm about my neck and the same
to the comrade on the other side, and presently I hear him
begin to snore; marching, and dead asleep,&mdash;until we
wake him up and another takes his place.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>What else comes out of the blur? The red smile of a
comrade who lay grinning at me in a shell hole all one
mortal day. I remember no one night, but I remember
distinctly Night in the trenches,&mdash;the winging bullets,
the occasional rocket, the rising, lumbering whirl of a
trench mortar, the sudden digging in against the damp
wall, a breathless wait, and then, somewhere up the line,
an explosion, and a shriek:</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ah, Jésu!</i>”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>But all this is the confusion of drifting fog. Out of
the months in the Val de Grace I can see but two faces,&mdash;the
provocative smile of a nurse, as a doctor whispered
in her ear amid the groans and delirium of a Senegalese
dying beside me, and another, the face of an old,
ugly woman, strangely devoted and untiring,&mdash;an old
woman on her hands and knees, scrubbing the floors for
us, who, I was told, was a Princess of the House of Bourbon.</p>

<p>Only these details come back to me. The war is too
near and too inevitable. I wish to escape it, if not entirely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
for a brief period. For inaction is what is demoralizing
now, inaction and the contemplation of the
approaching fact. The moment convalescence ends and
I step again into the ranks and feel the touch of a comrade’s
shoulder, before that accomplished fact, all will
seem obvious again,&mdash;but not now. All my instinct
now is to put from me this thing that approaches so relentlessly.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Two periods of my life stand out; the calm of the
early home days, and the disorder of two years in Paris;
two utterly, inexplicably different David Littledales; on
whom now I, a third personality, can look with some dispassionate
estimate.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>October</i></p>

<p>A budget of letters with a touch of home has sent me
back to my diary this morning, which, as I feared, I have
neglected these last weeks. At the time these letters had
been written no word had reached them of my having
been wounded at Verdun, and as I sat recalling the thousand
details of our daily life, I imagined how the family
would receive the news.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more characteristic of the Littledale
family than its departure to worship on Sunday morning.
We are organized on the theory of absolute liberty of
conscience in matters religious as well as political. My
mother and Ben departed in one direction for the Unitarian
Church, Aunt Janie to the Congregational, and
my father, Molly and myself for the little Presbyterian
chapel in the village square. Rossie, the privileged character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
of the family, remained in that state of suspended
judgment which permitted him to lengthen the Sunday
morning rest. No asperities, no dissensions resulted from
this opposition of views. In fact, each Littledale was a
little proud of the family’s individualism, regarding it as
the inherited trait of a strong intellectual strain.</p>

<p>We were four brothers and a sister, and all as different
as one day is from another. Because of my mother’s public
interests and her theories on individualism, we were
brought up with small restraint, along lines of our own
choosing. Alan, the third of the line, was the rebel of
the family. As I look back, I can see where the mistakes
were all on the part of Ben and myself. Wild, impatient
of restraint, Alan certainly was, yet the rough discipline
which the older brother inflicted was the worst method
of dealing with him. The two never understood each
other. Every idea and every instinct was opposed and
each in his way was remarkably unyielding in type.</p>

<p>While Rossie was alive, he and Molly, through their
good humor and affection, were able to hold the insurgent
in check, but after Rossie’s tragic drowning matters went
from bad to worse. Alan quickly assumed the traditional
rôle of the family black sheep.</p>

<p>In every respectable family of New England there is, I
suppose, always that predestined place. It had been so in
my father’s generation and in the generation before him.
We all, with the exception of Molly, who was too young
to have an opinion, expected that Alan would sooner or
later disgrace the family, and as we did not conceal from
him the state of our convictions he did his best to justify
them. After being expelled from two schools and dragged
into college by the application of every family influence,
there came the final storm. In his sophomore year he
became involved in a disgraceful row which reached the
columns of the metropolitan press. Alan was permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
to resign, returned home, had a violent scene with Ben
and my father, and departed, vowing never to set foot
in the family home again. That we were all unjust to
him admits of no doubt&mdash;I among the rest&mdash;but at
that time I was completely under the influence of Ben,
who was three years my senior.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I have left my brother Ben until the last: utterly different
from me in temperament, impulse and character,
he exercised over me the strongest domination. From
boyhood we had been inseparable. Study came laboriously
to him, to me naturally, so, despite the difference in
age, we passed through school and college together. Mentally
I was his superior but he exercised over me a moral
supremacy by the direct and ruthless expression of his
will. His strength lay in the fact that he was diverted
by no complexities. He had little imagination, read little,
and talked less. The two or three ideas which guided
him were settled convictions. Nothing perplexed him.
In all things he was a direct force.</p>

<p>I have noticed the same phenomenon in later life. Men
of little imagination and small mental baggage often dominate
men of superior imagination by the sheer tenacious
simplicity of never being in doubt of what they want. As
I see them now, Alan was revolt and Ben traditionalism in
its most rigid New England form. He was born to maintain
what was as it had been, a mid-Victorian in his
tastes, a Bourbon in his ideas,&mdash;quite capable, in another
era, of burning witches at the stake.</p>

<p>For better or for worse, our destinies have been tragically
intertwined,&mdash;how tragically, I alone know. His
code of morality would not have looked well in copy
books but, such as it was, it did have the advantage of
sincerity and a contempt for hypocrisy as he saw it in
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>To fight hard and fairly on any question; to do as he
believed every man of breeding did in months of relaxation,
but never to surrender the control of one’s self or
to be moved out of one’s calm by any wind of passion;
to take women as they came, lightly; but never to lie to
them or descend to petty meanness, or to become involved
in situations which compromised your dignity: this was
a code which savored rather of the <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">condottieri</i> of the
Middle Ages than of the Puritan traditions he represented.
Yet he saw in it no inconsistencies and, as men
go (and as I have known them), the code had certain
qualities of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noblesse oblige</i>. I have since turned from this
insolent egotism but for a long time it influenced my attitude
towards life and brought me close to disaster. Yet,
by establishing this moral tyranny, Ben saved me from
what would have been the shipwreck of my life.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>At the age of eighteen, in the summer of my Sophomore
year, I fell madly, foolishly in love with the
daughter of a farmer back of Littledale, Jenny Barnett,
a handsome little country girl, red-cheeked, black-haired,
and gray-eyed, the beauty of the county. Looking back
now, I can understand many things,&mdash;particularly with
the subsequent career of Jenny before me, but then I was
an extremely innocent youngster, whose head turned at
a look from the gray eyes in the warm odors of June, and
it would never have entered my imagination to entertain
the slightest suspicion of her. She, on her side, perceiving
what a greenhorn she had to deal with, made up her
shrewd little mind to set her cap for me. Before I knew
it, I had lost so completely all perspective that I seriously
considered a runaway match.</p>

<p>To-day it is all so incredible that I ask myself if I
could have proceeded so far, if, in the last test, a
saving grain of common sense would not have halted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
me, and I like to reason that I was but playing with an
idea, deceiving myself as much as the girl. Yet I do not
know that this is a fair estimate, for I have seen so much
of what men do under the narcotic impulse of passion,
even against their own will and intelligence, that I am
not certain I might not have played the fool,&mdash;without
the interception of my brother.</p>

<p>In my simplicity I had gone to him with my confidence.
I can still see the shock of amazement on his face.
Then he remained silent a long moment, his eyes on my
face.</p>

<p>“Absolutely sure you want to marry?”</p>

<p>“Oh, absolutely,” I said, yet my heart sank as though
I had pronounced my own sentence.</p>

<p>“And the girl,&mdash;Jenny? Absolutely sure she loves
you?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re making a fool of yourself, but that’s your
affair. I’ll see you through, that’s promised.”</p>

<p>His words brought me no joy. A cloud settled before
my eyes. At the end of half an hour, as though his mind
had been made up, he questioned me adroitly as to our
relations, our place of meeting, our next rendezvous. All
of which information I gave him, without mistrust. The
second day he came to me and said:</p>

<p>“What are you doing this afternoon? Nothing? Wait
for me in Talbot’s wood, by the old spring. I’ve got a
line on a honey tree. Meet me at four.”</p>

<p>“At four. I’ll be there,” I answered, not without surprise.</p>

<p>I installed myself in the wood at the appointed time
and shortly afterward, hearing familiar voices, I sprang
up and perceived Jenny on the arm of my brother. My
first thought was that he was bringing her to me in sign
of allegiance. The next moment, to my astonishment, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
saw her fling her arms about his neck and kiss him passionately,
very differently from the furtive embraces she
had vouchsafed me.</p>

<p>The next moment I was before them, with murder in
my heart. The girl sprang back with a cry. My hands
reached Ben’s throat and we went to the ground. In my
rage I understood but one thing,&mdash;that what he had done
he had done deliberately, after having put to sleep my
suspicions by an attitude of false acquiescence. My next
impulse was the most tragic and instinctive hatred which
can blind the reason of a human being,&mdash;the wild jealousy
of brother against brother. At the thought that the
girl could so easily have preferred him after all that
had been between us, all the love that I had for him
turned to the blackest fury, and I believe that for a short
moment if I could have killed him I would have done so.
The minx stood by, no longer frightened, but delighted
in her vanity at the sight of our struggling over her.</p>

<p>At first Ben had burst out laughing, defending himself
from my frantic rage but, little by little, under the sting
of my blows, he too lost his head. We rolled over and
over, clawing at each other frantically, striking out
blindly. I was no match for him then in strength, and at
the end I found myself on my back, my arms pinned
under his knees, looking up into his bruised face.</p>

<p>Suddenly he bent down and cried angrily:</p>

<p>“You little fool! Is that the sort of wife you want to
bring home!”</p>

<p>“You made her do it!” I cried, and in my rage I almost
succeeded in freeing myself. He exerted all his strength
and brought me back to earth.</p>

<p>“Made her do it! A girl that’s engaged to you? Do
you want to be the laughingstock of the country?”</p>

<p>My brain cleared and a great thankfulness came over
me. I began to laugh uproariously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>This was too much for Jenny. With a swish of her
skirts, she went flying through the woods.</p>

<p>I continued to laugh, with a sudden detention of all my
nerves, cut by sudden involuntary sobs, but the laugh
was not honest and something bitter and contemptuous
descended into my heart, there to remain.</p>

<p>“Let me up,” I said, at the end.</p>

<p>“All right?”</p>

<p>“Quite.”</p>

<p>We arose and surveyed the wreck we had made of
each other.</p>

<p>“I had to do it, Davy.”</p>

<p>“You did right.”</p>

<p>We shook hands and went home, his arm over my
shoulder, a rare demonstration of affection for him. Had
I only been present to render him a like service when
the rôles were reversed, years later!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There was no need of admonition and it was characteristic
of him that he never once referred to the episode.
All my anger turned on myself. I saw the fool
I had played and I swore that I would never be caught
again. From that time on vulgarity played no part in
my life. Milestone Number 1.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the thing that saved me was the blow
to my vanity. Even to this day I cannot recall the incident
without resentment and, though it is quite illogical,
I believe of all the episodes of my life this will always be
the one I shall think on with keenest humiliation. Even
between Ben and myself the memory has always
remained a secret irritation. For despite all my efforts
to fight down the feeling, I still retain a little resentment
at the superiority he had shown,&mdash;a primitive instinct
of the male, I suppose, particularly when a woman is
involved.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>V</h3>

<p>A revulsion was imperative, and the revulsion sent
me back to my own kind. There is, I suppose, in every
man’s life the figure of some woman who represents what
might have been; some turning point at which he looks
back and perceives where the direct road abruptly diverged.
My intimacy with Anne Brinsmade was not the
usual boy and girl romance but was something quite genuine
and loyal and, though in the end the inevitable complications
brought their misunderstandings, I look back
on this natural comradeship, which extended over two
years, with real affection. For this, strangely enough, I
had Jenny Barnett to thank. The anger in me against
my credulity and weak sentimentality was so insistent
that to recover some self-respect I felt the need of asserting
my ascendancy over some worthier one of her sex,
if but to prove to myself that I had the qualities of reticence,
authority and self-control I admired in my brother.
It was not premeditated or conscious, yet if it had been
skillfully calculated, nothing could have served me
better.</p>

<p>Stephen Brinsmade was a lawyer of large political and
business activities, a man of considerable fortune, and
Anne was surrounded with every luxury and attention
which he could shower on her. They had a big place at
Taunton, about fifteen miles from our home at Littledale,
and the friendship of the families was traditional.
In my case there was a deeper reason. At school I had
roomed with young Stephen and when he had died as the
result of an accident on the polo field, the memory of his
friendship brought me close to the father and sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>Anne, even as a young girl, was a problem. She was
all impulse, and no one knew where impulse might lead
her. I was approaching twenty and she was scarcely
sixteen at this time, and my air of determined impersonality
successfully piqued her curiosity, roused her resentment,
and finally drew her to me in impulsive trust.
Her brother had been my dearest chum. For his young
sister I could have only the most exact loyalty. I became
her confidant, assuming the rôle of mentor, and occasionally
delivered moral precepts with a gravity that was so
natural that it even eluded my sense of humor. Different
beings, I suppose, appeal to different qualities in us, according
to their needs, and there was something in the
wayward, lovable, undirected charm of the young girl
which aroused the chivalry in me. My attitude, so
different from that of the men who surrounded her, naturally
had two results. It brought a delightful companionship,
utterly free from mawkishness, or the simulated
coquetries and aped sentimentality which too often, in
the freedom of our American intercourse, leave the regret
in man and woman of having failed in reverence before
the things that count. Unconsciously, however, as this
intimacy continued, the feminine temptation was hard to
resist. Once or twice she tried to provoke my jealousy.
I do not think it was consciously done, but I recognized
it and my studied indifference undoubtedly gave
me an increasing value in her eyes.</p>

<p>The influence I exerted over her was, I know, the
strongest in her life. I saw that she idealized me and
though the incongruity of making a hero of me struck
me, a certain strength came from the realization. I never
fully believed in her and frequently told her so,&mdash;much
to her annoyance. I saw her as a young girl, too easily
influenced, with natural instinct towards the good, yet
with dangerous cravings for excitement and pleasure. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
knew as a woman she would be the creature of circumstances
and, foreseeing the flattery and adoration that
would be hers on her entrance into the world, I doubted
the stability of her best motives. On these subjects we
talked frankly, and once, with suddenly clouded face,
listening to me intently, she confessed in a burst of
feeling that my fears were justified and, genuinely moved,
placing her hand in mine, said:</p>

<p>“When I’m with you, Davy, I don’t want to be just
selfish and superficial. I do want other things in life;
but I know myself so well that&mdash;I’m afraid.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was in the summer after my graduation that I first
became aware that my own feelings were undergoing a
change. In the beginning I was master enough of myself
to control them, even when in daily contact with her implicit
trust and her too frankly shown desire for my company.
My reason warned me that my strength was in
her ignorance of my true state of mind but, at twenty-two,
with a young girl on the brink of a radiant and lovely
womanhood, the reason is but an intermittent refuge, and
propinquity and the moment, decisive. One night in mid-summer,
after a long and intimate discussion, when least
I expected it, at her hand freely and impulsively placed
in mine, every inhibition in me stopped. I raised
her fingers suddenly to my lips, drew a long breath and
held them there until, troubled, she sought to withdraw
them.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;David!”</p>

<p>She was looking at me, wide-eyed and wondering.</p>

<p>I tried to repair my blunder, hastily and awkwardly.</p>

<p>“You’re such a good sort, I was thinking&mdash;well, I’d
hate to have anything but the best come to you, later&mdash;”</p>

<p>She was still looking at me as I stopped, floundering.
I drew a long breath and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s chilly here. Let’s go in.”</p>

<p>She slipped her arm from mine and led the way back.
She said no word for the rest of the evening, while I exerted
myself to talk to her father, and left as soon as I
could make the opportunity. But I knew that she was
not deceived, then or later, by my new, almost hostile
attitude of aloofness.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The damage was done. From that day we never really
talked to each other. And here a curious thing happened.
Until then there had been no mistaking her preference
for me. It was so open that every one saw it,&mdash;her
father, my brothers, everybody. In fact, it was rather
looked upon as a matter of course that eventually we
should marry. I knew this. There are things which do
not deceive us and in the attitude of Mr. Brinsmade
there was even more than consent, though on the part of
the mother I felt an increasing antagonism.</p>

<p>Now, over night, all was changed. We avoided the
moments of intimacy which had come so naturally. Her
attitude became the extreme of capriciousness. I knew
I had blundered and believed that the blunder was irreparable,
but when I would deliberately refrain from
seeing her, she was certain to call me up and insist upon
my coming to dinner. Yet the moment I was in her
presence she was so silent and so moody that I always returned
with a feeling of hopelessness and disillusionment.
Hurt and miserable, my pride drove me to assume an
attitude of raillery, which crystallized in a studious
assumption of tolerant amusement and an apparent refusal
to see in her anything but a wayward child. She
resented this and never let pass an occasion to rouse my
jealousy. I was, in turn, mortified, proud, and angry.</p>

<p>My old doubts returned and, forgetting how much my
own attitude could excite irritation; forgetting how young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
she was in the knowledge of her own needs; forgetting
all that we had built upon together, I saw her only as an
inconscient child, disdaining the toy which she had finally
acquired. As her mother was, so I felt she would inevitably
become, and I ceased to believe that the memory
of our talks and the natural, kindly impulses in her would
ever be strong enough to counteract the craving for the
baubles of vanities which to-morrow would be thrown
into her lap.</p>

<p>What hurt me most was the seeming ungenerosity of
her attitude,&mdash;that after the years of unswerving loyalty
and protection I had given her she should now adopt
towards me the methods of a coquette. It ended on a
trifle. There was a scene of petty jealousy&mdash;I cannot
recall it now without astonishment&mdash;a dance accorded
and withdrawn,&mdash;nothing more. And yet for that, the
course of two lives was irretrievably affected. Perhaps
this was but the pretext. We were both high-spirited,
both too young to understand life’s values or the emotions
which swayed us, and both too proud to yield the
first. For a moment’s pique, we parted in anger,&mdash;I
have never seen her since. A month later I left for
Paris, to take up the study of architecture. Milestone
Number 2.</p>

<p>The memory quickly receded. I was, of course, too
young myself to have been truly capable of love. Yet
to-day, as I look back, but for that one instant’s wavering,
I can see how my whole life would have run. From
time to time I followed her career, saw her photograph
in the public fashion show blazoned forth in newspaper
and periodical; read occasional news of her reported engagements,
and then, lost in the maelstrom of a malevolent
infatuation, I put her finally from my mind, as at
that time I put from me all memories of a life where quiet,
order and simple ideals dominated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>I cabled home my decision to enlist. A month later,
among the frantic letters from the family, I found one
from her.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">Dear old Davy:</p>

<p>Molly has just told me and I can’t help writing to you. We
are no longer children, are we? And the old misunderstanding
was of a boy and a girl. I have always bitterly regretted it.
I don’t know whose fault it was,&mdash;perhaps both. If I was
to blame I am truly sorry. I have never forgotten the old
days or how fine you were with me. In all my life there has
been nothing more <i>honest</i>. I cannot bear to have you go
without knowing it. If you will let me, it will mean a great
deal to me if I could help just a little,&mdash;keep you in touch
with things at home, and let you know how many, many of
your friends are keeping you in their thoughts. May I,&mdash;please,
Davy&mdash;for old times.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">Just as I used to be,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Anne</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>I have the letter in my hand and to-day the memory
hurts. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cafard</i> is strong on me, and the futility of
my drifting existence. There are other letters, chatty,
carefully restrained letters, matching the tone of my
answers,&mdash;but this one I keep, for sometimes, in moments
of depression, in the passionate revulsion to living,
I turn to what might have been.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>At this point, Coustic came in with my orders. To-morrow
I am to set out for Paris, there to report before
an examining board. He stared at my long face and the
open diary.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, youngster?”</p>

<p>“Thinking of home, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon vieux</i>.”</p>

<p>“What are you writing there,&mdash;a romance?”</p>

<p>“It passes the time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>“Literature? Bad for the nerves. Don’t do it. You
can’t change anything&mdash;can you?”</p>

<p>“Evidently not.”</p>

<p>“Come with me. We’ll dine at La Mère Argentine’s,&mdash;a
couple of red bottles and&mdash;to hell with the rest! <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Moi,
je suis philosophre.</i>”</p>

<p>Which, after all, was the best thing I could do. And
so, out for a last dinner with Coustic and Valentin and
then no more. Quick friends and open hearts,&mdash;but
when you haven’t the time, as Coustic says, to smell
a man over, it must be open-handed and open-hearted
at once. Besides, one man is as good as another,
to smoke with, to dine with, and to damn the politicians.&mdash;I
drank my two bottles and sang with the loudest, but
it cured nothing. To-night I feel the dead weight of
homesickness as never before. The prospect of Paris
brings no pleasure.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>VI</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>Paris</i></p>

<p>At the Quai d’Orsay, where I debarked three nights
ago, the old days came back to me with a vividness of
pain which I had not expected; the old careless days of
another world which has been snuffed out. I walked out
alone, being <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en permission</i>, feeling my way along the
black banks of the hidden Seine. The street where she
had lived was close at hand and habit was so strong that
despite my reason I felt the tug of old instinct. Where
was now that light, reckless crowd, so indefatigable in
the scampering pursuit of pleasure? Scattered to the four
winds of heaven. Most of the women have drifted away,&mdash;some
to London, some to America; one, a fortune’s
favorite, died in an air raid; another, a suicide after her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
lover’s death, one whom I had not thought capable of a
real passion. The test of war has redeemed some of the
men&mdash;there were the good with the bad&mdash;by some spark
of a saving ancestry, perhaps simply from a gambler’s
love of a new hazard. Those who were born to fight have
found a purpose; the rest,&mdash;well, it does not much matter
what has become of the froth: all that matters is that
a man or two, whom once we despised, has redeemed
himself with an heroic death. All these memories are
inseparably bound up with the experience which, I suppose,
was bound to come into my life,&mdash;that I believed
erased from my memory, but which to-day remains a
haunting, ominous specter which sooner or later must be
faced.</p>

<p>The memory that obtrudes is of a clouded page in my
life&mdash;a chapter which I fatuously hoped had been closed
and laid aside forever&mdash;something to be regretted, to
stand as a warning in the future, and yet inclining me to
a greater charity. This I know is the experience of many
men. That in my case, by some malignant turn of the
fates, it should remain in tragic permanence, is something
against which I rebel.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I think that I can now look back dispassionately upon
the David Littledale of 1913 and recognize the impulses
which led me into an infatuation which, without the outbreak
of the great war, would in all probability have left
me a moral wreck.</p>

<p>Even as I write this severe judgment, I react against it.
Perhaps I am too harsh upon myself. It may be that
of my own will I would have found the strength to free
myself of the humiliating bondage&mdash;perhaps&mdash;but I
am not sure.</p>

<p>Yet I am quite certain that not for a moment was I in
love with Madame de Tinquerville. Curiosity, vanity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
habit, idleness; the pride of a young man still a boy in
the ways of the world; a fancied domination over a
woman accomplished in artifice; an unsated appetite for
pleasure; susceptibility to flattery; the old Littledale
failing of intense exaggeration in all things; all these
motives I clearly see. And then,&mdash;I was playing at love,
which often is more dangerous than love itself.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I have frequently heard women of the demimonde referred
to as dangerous women. There is nothing dangerous
in such women except to a young and inexperienced
man, with quick sympathies and a conscience. They
carry their warning on their faces. The woman who is
truly dangerous is the unsuspected woman who waits behind
the mask of a Madonna. Since my arrival, twenty
instances have reminded me of the woman I knew as
Letty, Madame de Tinquerville.</p>

<p>I do not know that I can be entirely dispassionate as I
look back over this incident in my life. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Tout comprendre
c’est tout pardonner</i>: to understand everything is to forgive
everything. There may have been in her life, in her
inheritance, or in her tradition&mdash;perhaps in her earlier
contact with men&mdash;things which would make her comprehensible.
I do not know them. There is a mystery
of evil and good in us that defies analysis. It is so in my
case; it must be so in hers. And yet,&mdash;she is the only
human being in my experience who did evil from the
sheer delight of doing it. She did it as a child plays
with some defenceless animal. Yet there was nothing
obvious about her, and in all the different societies through
which she moved I doubt if more than five men ever suspected
what lay behind her quiet, strictly conventional
attitude toward life.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I met her first at the studio of a fashionable artist,
Enrico Gonzalez, in the midst of a Goya fête, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
the fashionable, slightly <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déclassée</i> society of cosmopolitan
Paris had come, eager for a new sensation.</p>

<p>I saw her directly I had passed under the swinging lanterns
and entered the glowing studio. Amid the gay confusion
of reds and yellows, greens and purples of gala
Spain, she stood out, slight and dark in the black velvet
serenity of her costume,&mdash;an infanta with a certain
intuitive dignity of childish astonishment.</p>

<p>She saw my persisting look, studied me a moment, and
asked a friend to present me. The next moment I was
at her side, flattered, inviting her to dance.</p>

<p>She shook her head with a smile.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;not dance?”</p>

<p>“Never, in public.”</p>

<p>She motioned me to a seat and, looking at me intently,
said:</p>

<p>“Tell me, where have we met before?”</p>

<p>“I am certain that I have never seen you.” I was on
the point of adding, “For I could not have forgotten it,”
but instinctively feeling how banal the answer would seem
to her satiated ears, I refrained.</p>

<p>She looked at me, unconvinced.</p>

<p>“You are quite certain?”</p>

<p>“Yes, quite.”</p>

<p>“As children, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>My manner seemed to amuse her. She studied my
face a moment, and then said:</p>

<p>“You are from the South; from Virginia, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“Not even that. A Yankee from Connecticut.”</p>

<p>“Strange! I shouldn’t have thought it.”</p>

<p>After a moment, as if her interest in me had ceased,
she asked:</p>

<p>“You like to dance, of course?”</p>

<p>I bowed my assent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>“There is a little girl from the Opéra over there who
dances beautifully. Ask her to dance.” Then, as I
rose, perplexed, not quite certain whether to be angry
or not,&mdash;“and later, come back and talk to me.”</p>

<p>The conversation had been in French and, though
I was certain she was not of that nationality, I was unable
to place her. I know that my first movement was
one of mistrust, for my answers had been unnecessarily
brusque. For no reason whatsoever I was conscious of
an instinctive antagonism and yet I obeyed her suggestion
and began a tango. From time to time I glanced
in the direction of Madame de Tinquerville but, though I
was certain she was observing me, each time I sought her
glance I found her in languid conversation with the group
of young men who surrounded her.</p>

<p>The dance ended. With a growing antagonism, I
asked myself why I had so docilely followed her request.
With a resentment that was like a child’s, I avoided her
and did not speak to her again that night. This was the
instinctive revulsion of our first meeting.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Yet from the crowd I watched her. Very small, she
seemed slighter for the prevailing note of black. The
only note of color was the natural brilliance of her lips,&mdash;extraordinary
lips, full and, the lower one, sensuously
so, lips that had just been plunged into strawberries;
eyebrows like the flight of ravens’ wings; a nose that
might have been Cleopatra’s, thin-bridged and slightly
irregular; eyes black as Africa, not nervously alert like
the glance of the city woman, which is crowded with
shifting details, but with the fixed contemplation of one
accustomed to gaze steadily towards far horizons and
clear spaces.</p>

<p>Her manner? At first contact utterly impersonal, interested
only in herself, in her pretty poses, her transparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
fingers and her dainty feet. I remember thinking
that one might live with such a woman a lifetime and
never know her inmost thoughts,&mdash;if thoughts there were
behind the mask. She had two characteristic smiles
which I learned to know; one for the public,&mdash;the smile
that she wore like a necklace. Occasionally, when something
stirred a slumbering spark in her, a smile all excitement
and vibration suffused her face like the flash
of footlights: it was then that mischief was brewing. My
first impression was of distrust: of a woman all instinct,
tyrannous, jealous, adroit, feline, languid, brooding, voluptuous,
hidden and, above all, without sense of pain,
either for herself or for others.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I retained only a troubling memory of this pungent,
irritating impression when, a few days later, I received
a formal note inviting me to call. I was flattered. I
went.</p>

<p>She was alone. She made no reference to my avoiding
her, led me to talk with intelligence, turned any approach
to intimacy, and was so natural and gracious
that I asked myself in astonishment why I should
have felt such a sudden antagonism. In a short
time, without my being able to distinguish the gradual
progression, I was enveloped in the insidious charm of
her personality as completely as though she had bound
me hand and foot. For six months I forgot everything
else in the world and followed where she led, allowing
her slender fingers to turn my destiny according to their
malicious fancy.</p>

<p>How did she do it? As skilfully as one plays a trout.
Indifference&mdash;with a sudden touch of simulated interest,
immediately withdrawn as soon as offered&mdash;a little opening
of the doors to intimacy and, once I had learned to
expect it, an abrupt refusal; the power to read me and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
to rouse my appetites and my vanities: in a word, the ability
to create the illusion of being pursued and of waking
in me the instinct of the pursuer.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I learned of her life only by hearsay, never from her
own lips. Paris is full of just such women; the drift
of strange currents, out of mysterious beginnings. Her
father was an Irish adventurer, John Finucane, who by
devious and clouded ways had amassed some fortune in
Egypt and the Orient. Her mother, according to one
story, was the daughter of an Arab sheik; according to
another, a gypsy; others ascribed to her the rôle of a
woman of the circus, a wandering mountebank. I saw
her once and, allowing for all exaggerations, she was undoubtedly
of some Eastern strain,&mdash;an inheritance apparent
in Letty. Madame de Tinquerville had married
early an old roué of that well-known family, impoverished
and exiled to a minor diplomatic position, and who,
shortly after bringing his bride and her fortune back to
Paris, left her a widow.</p>

<p>She was, I am certain, thoroughly conscient in everything
she did. The corruption she exerted over me was
both mental and moral. I had come back to Paris filled
with enthusiasm and ambition. My self-discipline disappeared.
I threw myself into a life of pleasure and dissipation.
My days were disorganized and I obeyed only
the craving for excitement, movement, and rapidly succeeding
sensations. My old philosophy, simple and proud,
yielded to the worldly wisdom of the facile luxury which
surrounded me. I saw how easy it was to achieve by
social trafficking what men spent lifetimes laboriously to
acquire.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Not that I yielded without a struggle. At times, scenes
of extreme violence broke out between us; scenes I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
realize now it was her delight to provoke. Though of
strong and violent passions, I had always held myself in
firm control. What had been an orderly, measured mode
of life, contemplative, tolerant, and good-humored, now
became a tumultuous succession of days and nights, when
every nerve was raw to the exposure. I found myself
irritable, suspicious, passing from sudden depressions
to feverish flights of gayety; quick at offence and wincing
under the new tortures which she invented each day for
the perverse delight of proving to herself how completely
she held me in subjection. Why I did not strangle her
in some blind moment of rage, I do not know.</p>

<p>This I will say: she did not lack courage. It never
failed her in the dangerous excesses of jealousy she provoked
in me, for, even as my fingers itched to close over
her delicate throat, at a sudden smile, at a look in the
shadowy eyes, at a caress from her fingers, the heat would
vanish from my brain and I would be pliant in her hands.
Perhaps it was this constant revolt&mdash;the rough, untamed
animal in me&mdash;that interested her. Did she care for me,
or not? At this moment, despite the tragic sequence of
events, I am not certain but that at bottom, despite all her
malignant appetites, her joy in destruction, her catlike
love of cruelty, for some unknown reason, she genuinely
loved me,&mdash;so far as she could comprehend love. Sometimes
I believe that the secret of her attachment to me
was in my resemblance to some one whom she had known
and loved&mdash;as a young girl loves&mdash;before the flood of
corruption had contaminated her. It may be that I recalled
this other by some trick of look or manner. I do not
know. I know very little of her past life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>VII</h3>

<p>As I try to reconstruct this episode, much of it remains
blurred,&mdash;a confused repetition of fatiguing emotions;
scenes of jealousy no sooner ended than begun
again: revulsions in me away from her, weak returns:
the obsession of her presence; her caprices and her demands
disorganizing all the routine of a once methodical
existence. Only a few scenes come back to me vividly.
Of her life I know as little as of the motives which ran
in her agile mind. I am beginning to see her now with a
colder point of view; then I did not understand her at
all. We never discussed her life or mine,&mdash;that is, what
had happened before our meeting.</p>

<p>I do not know her age exactly (perhaps twenty-five,
perhaps thirty) yet she seemed always of another generation,
and old in the wisdom of experience. I had often
the curious feeling of not looking at her but at the mirror
of a woman, and of never being able to progress beyond
the pale reflection.</p>

<p>As I try to analyze her now, her salient quality was an
utter inability to feel pain. Nor do I believe she could
understand it in others, even when for her own enjoyment
she was its cause. She was, of course, one of those women
of over-refined temperament who simulate sensations
they no longer can feel, seeking mentally what is no
longer a natural impulse. Her curiosity in inflicting pain
was of this nature.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Occasionally, however, she was capable of an amazing
frankness, whether by cunning or from the inconsistency
of her woman’s nature. Once, when I sought to penetrate
beyond her reserve&mdash;the occasion was after an accidental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
meeting with her mother as we were driving in
the Bois&mdash;she said something to me in such prophetic
artlessness that to this day I wonder if for one moment
this was not the true Letty.</p>

<p>Our carriages had met and passed and for an instant
I had felt her suddenly rigid at my side. I looked over
and saw something out of Letty’s past,&mdash;a thin, crooked
old lady, very black, bejeweled and grotesquely dressed,
who was agitating a pink parasol as though it were a bell-rope,
to attract our attention. The next second, and we
had passed.</p>

<p>“Your mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>She had been too startled to deny it.</p>

<p>“Letty,” I said eagerly, for the tone of her voice threw
an air of romantic mystery about her figure to me, “don’t
you want to,&mdash;can’t you tell me something of your life?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“To you, if to any one. Don’t ask me. It is too painful!”</p>

<p>She added, and at such moments I felt twenty years
rushing in between us:</p>

<p>“Life is only a succession of doors to be closed and
never reopened. I never do.”</p>

<p>Something made me reply:</p>

<p>“Not very flattering to me.”</p>

<p>She looked at me, and answered:</p>

<p>“Oh, you! How you will hate me, some day!”</p>

<p>It was by such unexpected remarks, by the very seeming
frankness of an abrupt confession, that she knew how
to rouse my curiosity and to surround herself with
a glamor of mystery. I believed in her sorrows until the
day came when I was shocked out of my fatuity and saw
the feline delight in playing with a wounded animal which
alone was insatiable in her character.</p>

<p>I have often wondered over that speech and why she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
had made it. A sense of the dramatic, a moment’s indulgence
in absolute truth, a sure sense of the effect on
my tempestuous imagination, to be warned of danger?
Perhaps, all three.</p>

<p>“<i>Life is only a succession of doors to be closed and
never reopened.</i>”</p>

<p>It is strange how a phrase remains when a memory
has been conquered. This phrase, which summed up all
her defiant, selfish, worldly wisdom, has come back to
me again and again and, though I am freed of the tyranny
of her malicious personality, the poison of her
philosophy still lurks in my memory.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There are moments when we look back in cold memory
and cannot comprehend the whence and the wherefore of
the hot fever that once dominated every sense and drove
us through the hallucination of a passion. So with me,
to-day.</p>

<p>When I think of Jenny Barnett, I seem to remember
a confidence told me by a friend of college days: when
I recall Letty, I seem to recall a chapter in some unhealthy
romance. It is impossible that I and that David
Littledale are one and the same person!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The heart of a man is like running water,&mdash;the years
in their course purify the moral contagion. I do not
know that this is true of all men. Perhaps those who remain
in the stagnant pools of little existence never free
themselves of the scum of the past; yet it is true of those
who venture out into the traveling current. In a large
sense, it is true of the generations, that move as great
rivers move,&mdash;and in this running purification is the
hope of all society.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Why, at this period of my life, should I have fallen
so completely under the spell of such a woman as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Madame de Tinquerville? It was not genuine love that
caused it, for as I conceive love it is the calm of a great
certainty,&mdash;and with Letty it was never anything but
a ceaseless conflict. If not Letty, would it have been
some one else? Was it an experience which I was to
undergo,&mdash;an impulse that came from within me,
rather than from outside? Perhaps I understand better
to-day the springs of my impulses.</p>

<p>There are in most men two strong and opposite impulses
towards women which, at first sight, appear contradictory
but are easily reconcilable, as they spring from
the two linked needs of their natures and are the key to
the many seeming inconsistencies, infidelities, abrupt passions
and incomprehensible tyrannies into which their
sentimental cravings lead them. A man seeks in woman
saint and sinner, calm and tempest, salvation and demoralization.</p>

<p>As architects of life our instincts are towards order
and discipline, yet we are eternally seeking the thing
that will upset our self-control. We are irresistibly attracted
by what threatens our equanimity, enslaves our
senses, imprisons our will,&mdash;for that brief, fleeting ecstasy
which we feel at its fullness only when we are aware
that we have cast aside the reins of our government. But,
as the abiding instinct of our nature is order, there remains
always the ideal of woman, which represents the
revulsion to sanity, calm and serenity,&mdash;back to which
we grope with reverence and to which we fasten with
the instinct of self-preservation. I know this is true,
though to-day this woman, the woman who is serenity
and order, has not come into my life.</p>

<p>So intimately entwined are these two natures, these
twin struggling impulses, that they often remain confused
and inseparable. This is the explanation of the
two tragedies of society, each proceeding from the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
complex source: the phenomenon of a man’s marrying his
mistress and that darker mystery which remains behind
the curtain of marriage, the debasing of an ideal once
raised in reverence.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The ease with which I yielded to her dominance, the
disorganization into which I plunged, and the violent revulsion
which came in the end are explainable, I believe,
by this conflict in our nature. But then I did not reason
thus, I did not reason at all, and therein lay the danger,&mdash;a
danger that I shudder now to contemplate.</p>

<p>What was the essence of this corruption which she
exercised over me,&mdash;that was more moral and mental
than physical? It was in the stifling of all the youth and
ambition of my nature by the baleful weight of her age-old
weariness of intellect. She took a keen delight in seeking
out my illusions, one by one; of slowly destroying them
before my eyes under her malicious wit. She taught me
that all striving was futile, that youth was a season of
riotous enjoyment for the wise, and that only fools sacrificed
it in a groaning pursuit of an ambition which could
never be attained.</p>

<p>“Why strain for the thing that is here, at your finger
tips? This is the fullness of life; seize it. What would
you seek?&mdash;a career?&mdash;fame? My dear little Davy,
you are not a genius. Your talents are not even considerable.
The chances are that after ten years of drudgery you
would only have condemned yourself to the bitterness of
disillusionment! What do men seek in fame? Just the
vanity that a pretty woman has to be noticed as she
enters a restaurant. Believe me, the quality of youth,
which you hold so lightly, is worth all your drowsy,
rheumatic celebrities! You have senses given you to
enjoy life with,&mdash;enjoy it!”</p>

<p>“And, the end&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>“Who knows what may be the end? Rather remorse
than regrets!”</p>

<p>All her philosophy was summed up in this sentence.
Yet she was exceedingly punctilious in her religious observances
and, although she had a sort of dare-devil
courage, she hated so the intrusion of realities that she
would turn down a side street rather than meet a funeral.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The struggle to free myself was a hideous one. Again
and again I determined to fling off the unhealthy bondage
that weighed on my freedom of thought, and as often,
from weakness, from fear of giving pain, with rage and
hatred in my soul, I temporized. The fear of giving
pain! How it holds a man at the last to his own destruction!
For I was still innocent enough of what such
a world can hold of depravity to believe that, such as
she was, she loved me with all the good and bad of her
nature.</p>

<p>Once, after a week of mutual recriminations, driven
beyond my strength by her simulated scenes of jealousy,
I went to her, determined to provoke a final rupture. I
can still remember the rage in my heart as I came into her
salon that night of the final rupture that calls out the
primitive criminal which abides in all of us. For criminal
instinct is essentially the instinct of the survival of the
fittest, and in that moment when, rightly or wrongly, we
reach the frenzy where we must tear from us the arms
that hold us back,&mdash;we destroy as criminals destroy. I
cannot think of what might have happened that night,
without a shudder.</p>

<p>I came resolved to wound her on the raw, to force her
out of her calm, and in the clash of our hatreds to find
my escape. Yet, despite taunts and insults, she remained
superbly self-possessed,&mdash;complete mistress of the situation.
When from very exhaustion I stopped, she looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
up at me, with her smile of Mona Lisa, her eyes sparkling
with triumph, and said carelessly:</p>

<p>“So you love me as much as that!”</p>

<p>“Love you?” I cried, choking with inarticulate rage.
I tried to continue but I could not. I felt that if I remained
another minute in her presence I did not know
what I might do. “The end&mdash;thank God! The end!”</p>

<p>I flung up my arms, with a horrible laugh, and bolted
for the door. But as I went I heard her clap her hands,
as a delighted child might have done, and her voice came
to me:</p>

<p>“David&mdash;you will come back.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>And back I returned, to delude myself, once more,
with her sudden melting repentance, to listen to her self-accusation,
to believe that all she had done wickedly and
consciously had been only the instinct of a jealous woman
to know how completely she was loved. Not a delectable
page in my life. I set it down as it happened, without
extenuation. Yet, two days later, I was free of her, forever!
She lied to me and I caught her in the lie.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We were to have dined together and to have gone to
the theater, but she had written me the day before that
she would be forced to leave town. This had often happened
and this postponement did not in the least excite
my suspicion. A young Frenchman, the Comte Maurice
Plessis de Saint Omer, one of my intimate friends, happened
to drop in on me, and agreeing to dine together,
we set out for Foyot’s, near the Luxemburg, bent on an
epicurean dinner and a quiet evening.</p>

<p>Maurice de Saint Omer, in the pleasure-seeking crowd
in which we moved, had the reputation of being a great
dandy and my natural attraction towards him was considerably
enhanced by the compliment to my vanity. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
came of one of the great families of France which named
its ancestors before the Crusades (his father was the
Duc de Saint Omer and the château is the famous one
near the Lorraine border). While he lived the life of a
thorough man of the world, as it was understood in the
Paris before the war, he brought to all relations of life
dignity and distinction. He was neither rake nor profligate.
Straight, tawny-haired, nose high-bridged and sensitively
chiseled, blue-eyed and soft of voice, almost too
elegant for our American ideal, his courage and tact had
made him one of the arbiters on the field of honor. Why
he should have taken to me, I do not know, but he did,
and he occasionally favored me with his confidences. My
own entanglement with Madame de Tinquerville was
known to him. In fact, for months all his influence had
been exerted to show me the quicksands into which I was
sinking. We were talking of her as we neared the restaurant.</p>

<p>“And La Belle Tinquerville?”</p>

<p>“I was to have dined with her to-night but she was
called to St. Germain.”</p>

<p>“No use warning you, my dear fellow, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Evidently not,” I answered moodily. “I must work
out my fate alone.”</p>

<p>“At least&mdash;open your eyes.”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“Neither she nor you is the slightest in love.”</p>

<p>“What do you call it, then, when one moment you are
ready to do murder, and the next you are as weak as a
child, ready to believe anything, undergo anything, afraid
of everything?”</p>

<p>“My dear friend, I went through that, at the age of
sixteen, with a little girl in a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laiterie</i> who could not
write five words correctly and who ran off with a lawyer’s
clerk. The trouble is you are still sixteen. You know, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
do not discuss women lightly; my principles are fixed on
that point. But you have come to me as a friend and as a
friend I am once more going to warn you.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” I said, shrugging my shoulders.</p>

<p>“My dear David,&mdash;you have no place in this society
of ours,” he said, taking my arm. “You have a heart,
and you have no knowledge of the conventions of the
game. We do not love in this crowd; we play at love; just
as we do not discuss; we play at discussing. We meet, to
fence lightly and gracefully, with tremendous lunges,&mdash;which
are always parried. We do not seek a woman because
we want her but because twenty other men want her
and&mdash;we wish to carry off the prize. You are seeking romance,
and&mdash;it has never crossed our thresholds. This
society is old: it refines only on its emotions. It is egotistical,
selfish, superficial, and self-indulgent. There isn’t a
man or woman in it who doesn’t love himself or herself
better than anything else in the world. Madame de
Tinquerville may be better, or worse, than the rest of her
set. I do not know. If you were an American nabob, perhaps
she might make up her mind to marry you. Luckily,
you are not. There is something primitive enough in you
to resist and rebel. There is still something young in
you,&mdash;a piece of a real heart left. When she has completely
broken you, dominated you and corrupted you,
you will cease to interest her. Bid her good-by before
she closes the door in your face.”</p>

<p>“Every word you say is the truth,” I said impulsively,
“but,&mdash;then&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know,&mdash;I know,” he said, laughing, and then, turning
to a more serious tone, he added, “Do not think me
cynical. I am not. There exist in this world women that
are worthy to be loved, in reverence. One day I shall
meet a young girl whom I can respect and adore as I do
the ideal of womanhood that is in my mother and sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
but when I take a wife I shall never bring her to this poisoned
atmosphere. David, if you were a man of the
world, if you could keep to the surface of things, I should
shrug my shoulder, but you can not.” He gripped my
arm tightly. “You are not even a man. Confess that it
is only your vanity that holds you, that at bottom you
hate this entanglement that humiliates you and corrupts
you.”</p>

<p>“It is a nightmare,” I said gloomily.</p>

<p>“Well, then?”</p>

<p>“In her way,” I said, “she loves me.”</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at me in amazement at my innocence.
I did not understand his look then. I do, now.
He started to speak. I can imagine what was on the tip
of his tongue but, beyond a certain point his notion of
chivalry would not permit him to go.</p>

<p>“In that case, my dear David, I have nothing more to
say. Your appetite, at least, is not affected?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least.”</p>

<p>“Then a very good solution to all problems is a certain
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Canard au vin blanc</i> and gooseberries, that Carlo will
cook for us with his own hands!”</p>

<p>We had ascended the old Rue de Tournon, the Senate
rising ahead of us. We entered the restaurant, and the
first person I saw was Madame de Tinquerville, dining
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en tête-à-tête</i> with a man unknown to me.</p>

<p>She looked up, saw me, and glanced down again,
quickly. We passed into the inner room and took a table.
Something exploded in my brain.</p>

<p>“You saw?” said De Saint Omer.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You are convinced?”</p>

<p>“Quite. The man?”</p>

<p>“Pedro Fornesco,&mdash;an Argentine millionaire.”</p>

<p>“How long has this been going on?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>“Three months.”</p>

<p>I began to laugh. De Saint Omer slipped his hand
over my wrist.</p>

<p>“David&mdash;it is Providence.”</p>

<p>“Thank God,” I said loudly, but, despite myself, I felt
a cold in the small of my back and a dryness in my throat.</p>

<p>“Will you follow my advice?” he said, studying me
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Wait.” I put my head in my hands and drew great
breaths, while I fought for calm and decision.</p>

<p>“Now.”</p>

<p>“You are sure of your control?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p>“No scenes?”</p>

<p>“I give you my word.”</p>

<p>“That must be understood,” he said firmly. “No public
scandal&mdash;no dramatics, my friend, or as sure as you
are sitting here you will have to answer to me. Is that
understood?”</p>

<p>“I assure you I never was more master of myself,” I
said, smiling, and, indeed, a cold indifference had come to
me. I felt a tempest raging in my brain and somewhere
in that tempest a voice crying, “Now or never!”</p>

<p>“Very well, I believe you. Carlo!” The head waiter
came hastily to us.</p>

<p>“Carlo. A table opposite M. Fornesco,&mdash;the one that
is engaged.”</p>

<p>“M. le Comte&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Carlo&mdash;this is an exception. I <i>must</i> have it.”</p>

<p>His eye met the head waiter’s, who hesitated and
bowed. We rose and, sauntering into the main dining
room, seated ourselves two tables away from Madame de
Tinquerville, in an angle that was partitioned off from
the rest of the room. When, with an appearance of casualness,
I turned to watch her, I saw in her eyes a look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
of abject terror. Every such woman believes more or
less in the dramatics of Camille and, from that moment
to the end, I know Letty awaited the public scene that
would strip her sacred reputation and leave her the butt
of Paris gossip. As for myself, I was at that moment
capable of the greatest cruelty without the turning of a
hair: I found resources of self-control in me that astounded
me. I laughed, discussed affairs of the day whimsically,
and swapped anecdotes, as though out on a collegian’s
holiday. Madame de Tinquerville watched me
from the corner of her eye, never losing me from her gaze,
listening, <span class="locked">waiting&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Towards the end of the dinner, De Saint Omer said to
me:</p>

<p>“You know the anecdote on Gommecourt,&mdash;no?
Quite amusing. I’ll tell it to you. Besides,&mdash;there is
a moral.”</p>

<p>“A moral?” I said, feeling that the comedy was about
to begin.</p>

<p>“Gommecourt was a young parvenu of the time of
the Regence who had become involved in an affair with a
celebrated actress of those days. He was avaricious,
vain, prudent, and not without a certain wit, as you shall
see.”</p>

<p>The conversation at Madame de Tinquerville’s table
had stopped. De Saint Omer’s voice could be heard distinctly,
and I knew that Letty was listening breathlessly.</p>

<p>“When it was time for Gommecourt to marry, he was
much embarrassed how to break away from his charming
but expensive friend. He took up a pen and wrote a long
and very tender letter, recalling his past happiness, his
regret at the decision of his family,&mdash;a very, very moving,
affectionate, temperamental and tragic letter, and at
the end he wrote, ‘I shall never forget, and I send you
an order for one hundred thousand francs.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>“Very handsome,” I said mechanically, not yet seeing
daylight.</p>

<p>“A little too handsome&mdash;as Gommecourt decided,
after a very brief struggle. He wrote a second letter, a
very tender letter, too, but a little modified in its transports
of passion, and ended by announcing a gift of fifty
thousand francs.”</p>

<p>“Very prudent.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it? You see, Gommecourt was of good,
thrifty stock. The more he considered it, the more absurd
it seemed to him to give way to his impulses. And
then, suppose she had not been faithful? He wrote a
third letter, quite formal this time, and cut the sum
to twenty thousand francs.”</p>

<p>By this time the conversation at the other two tables
had ceased, and every one was listening, quite frankly
amused at De Saint Omer’s vivacious account.</p>

<p>“So, Gommecourt, quite delighted with his two transactions
by which he had saved himself eighty thousand
francs, arose to send off letter number three. But,
halfway to the bell, suddenly he stopped, struck his
forehead and exclaimed, ‘But, after all, it’s simpler than
that!’ And, returning to the table, he wrote a final letter,
thus,&mdash;‘I have discovered all. Adieu.’”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” I cried loudly, above the ripple of laughter
which greeted the ending. “And he was right.”</p>

<p>“You like the anecdote?”</p>

<p>“Excellent.” I glanced at Madame de Tinquerville
and saw her rigidly examining her plate. “But it doesn’t
fit all cases,&mdash;since we are now talking of ruptures.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a friend of mine had an even better expedient!”</p>

<p>“I should like to know it,” I remarked, pretending to
laugh. “One never knows&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He simply took his card and marked on it ‘P.P.C.’
and left it at her home. That, and nothing more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>“Thanks for the idea.”</p>

<p>I drew out my portfolio instantly and selected a card.
The couple next to us, deceived by my gayety, began to
laugh.</p>

<p>“A pencil?”</p>

<p>“Be careful!” said De Saint Omer, under his breath.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry.”</p>

<p>I took the pencil he offered me, after a little hesitation,
and inscribed the three letters.</p>

<p>“Carlo! An envelope&mdash;and call a taxi.”</p>

<p>“David! No scene.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, I tell you.”</p>

<p>I addressed the envelope, slipping the card into it and,
the reckoning being paid, rose and stood deliberately
facing Madame de Tinquerville. For that one awful
moment, which I prolonged, I paid her back in terror
the thousand humiliations of those hideous months.</p>

<p>Then we lifted our hats with exaggerated ceremony
and went out.</p>

<p>We left the letter at her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">concierge’s</i> and went directly
to my apartment.</p>

<p>“You have letters&mdash;keepsakes&mdash;of hers?” asked De
Saint Omer.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“Make a package of them and leave them with the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">concierge</i>, to be given to her when she calls&mdash;”</p>

<p>“When she calls?”</p>

<p>“Idiot, she will come at once! And now, throw some
things in a bag, and come away with me for a couple of
weeks’ fishing.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>As I look back at it now I am filled only with a feeling
of nausea. All I can say in extenuation of this period,
when the thinking man had ceased and was near to the
brute, is that for weeks I had not been master of myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
that I moved in a delirium of passionate anger, weak
jealousy, with every nerve unstrung and every impulse
riotous, incapable of either controlling or judging my
action.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It is not a chapter that I like to contemplate but, as
it was I write it down. For the mystery of evil is that
out of it there often comes a revulsion to sanity. I am
not sure but in the end it was beneficial. The shock of
experience made me see myself as I was, and after the
disorganization the primeval spirit of order awoke in
me, and now that I am seeking to build up again it is
as my own mason, consciously and responsible.</p>

<p>The trouble with the New England tradition is its lack
of flexibility. Nothing gives, but it breaks. Yield the
slightest, and everything crumbles. We lack a sure sense
of values and are therefore at the mercy of little things
as well as great. We conceive of man’s struggle against
the forces of demoralization as the defence of a fortress:
one breach made, and capitulation follows. More mature
reflection, tempered with a knowledge of good and
evil, has led me, I think, to a broader philosophy. We
are not intrenched in our beliefs but are mobile forces,
constantly maneuvering, constantly at war&mdash;turned
back here, advancing there&mdash;with only the ultimate objective
important.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We had been gone but four days when the war broke out
and we separated, he to join his regiment, and I to enlist
in the Foreign Legion. His last words to me were,
“David, my dear friend, if through weakness you return
now, you are worse than the most despicable of men,&mdash;you
will be utterly lost. After this, Madame de Tinquerville
will hate you or love you beyond anything else
in life,&mdash;and either will be fatal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>I did not see her again. I threw myself into the war as
a salvation, seeking an escape from a life that filled me
with horror, hating and despising myself, asking only
to forget. She wrote me many letters, frantic, repentant,
imploring an answer, and then a final one&mdash;the rage of
a woman scorned&mdash;full of veiled threats. I did not
answer them.</p>

<p>I heard indirectly that she had entered the Red Cross,
devoting herself with a courage and determination that
had surprised every one. When the memory had receded
and my normal self had returned, I was willing to believe
that the mobilization which had come to France as a
moral re-birth had perhaps reached the Magdalene in
her,&mdash;as in how many others! Yet, I wondered how
much the dramatic impulse was responsible.</p>

<p>But the scales had fallen from my eyes. It was not
against the woman but myself against which I revolted
with every force in me. The strange thing is that, once the
rupture was complete, she passed completely out of my
existence, and in a fortnight I was looking back upon
that period with incredulity. Events were too colossal
to remember private sorrows. I felt myself, at last, one
of a great army of action, redeemed to meaning and
purpose.</p>

<p>Those who did not see the mobilization can never have
a conception of all that war can bring of sublimity and
purification,&mdash;as those who never knew the first winter
in the trenches cannot imagine the long horror of that
soul-crushing defence. If the war had only ended in the
first year! But, it didn’t. Incredulity succeeded the
first flaming rise of faith. Neither the end nor the issue
can now be foreseen. Those who had faith remain in
that faith; others, to whom faith had come as a revealing
experience, have lapsed into the old easy habits. Life has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
readjusted itself along the lines of war, and society has
returned to its old divisions! So it must have been with
Madame de Tinquerville. By the end of the year the impulse
had burned out. The daily thing ceased to be dramatic.
Her old nature asserted itself. She drifted away
to England, and then to America, gradually and easily
back into the life of self-indulgence and pleasure she
craved.</p>

<p>I had not heard of her for over a year and a half when,
dragged out of the inferno at Verdun, transported from
a field hospital, more dead than alive, to the Hospital du
Val du Grace at Paris, I came out of a battle for life to
have a letter from my brother placed in my hands, announcing
his marriage to Letty, Madame de Tinquerville.</p>

<p>I went off into a delirium and for weeks fought against
a return to life. But the obstinate nature in me triumphed
over my will, and I found myself at last convalescent,
facing the issue of some day confronting the
brother I loved with the knowledge of the secret which
must always be between us.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The thing that frightens me, that leaves me cold when
I think of it, is this: Can she still have power over my
senses? I say I am certain that I never loved her, that
this yoked hostility, this mutual tyranny could not
be love, and yet&mdash;Something there was that was insidious
and instinctive, something that blinded me and
stopped my ears to warnings, and sent me to her with the
obsession of pursuit and conquest. I have seen infatuation
in other men and understood it, yet in myself it still is incredible.
If it had to be, I only hope it is a fever that
has burned itself out and left me immune for the future.&mdash;Yet
now, as I stop to analyze myself and my motives,
as I look back at that scene in the Café Foyot (I think
I suffered as much as she did), and remember the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
wild leap of animal rage when I saw her with Fornesco
at her side, I <span class="locked">wonder&mdash;</span></p>

Number 3.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>VIII</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>November</i></p>

<p>To-day I saw my brother, Alan, after six years.
Through a chance meeting, I found him living in the
Luxemburg quarter. A girl answered my knock. We
stood confronting each other, mutually surprised. I remembered
her among the restless habitués of the Abbé
de Thelême and the Café de Paris, in the old days. The
paint and artifice were gone. She stood there, dark-eyed,
frail, olive-tinted, considering me suspiciously, her woman’s
instinct warned of possible danger to the thing
she sheltered from the world.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Tiens</i>; it’s you, Toinon!”</p>

<p>She started forward and looked at me intently, but in
her multitudinous conception of man, my face was but a
blur in the panorama.</p>

<p>“It’s me you want to see&mdash;what’s your business?”</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Alan Littledale live here?”</p>

<p>“And if he does?”</p>

<p>“I am his brother.”</p>

<p>Instantly her manner changed.</p>

<p>“Ah, you’ve come to take him away, then?”</p>

<p>Before I could answer, a voice from within cried
querulously: “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Qui est là?</i>”</p>

<p>The next moment a big frame, topped by a shaggy head,
came into the anteroom.</p>

<p>“Hello, Alan!” I said, extending my hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>He drew back, scowling and undecided.</p>

<p>“What the devil brings you here?”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” I said, smiling. “You do happen to
be my own flesh and blood and, no matter how we’ve
fought in the past, we’re both Littledales, to the end.”</p>

<p>Now, Alan had scoffed and stormed against all our
traditions but, despite all, there still remained a lingering
pride in the name. He relented a little bit,&mdash;though
with ill grace.</p>

<p>“If you’re coming in to lecture me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t be an ass, Alan,” I broke in good-naturedly.
“I’m no more saint than you are. Well, am I to come
in or not?”</p>

<p>“You can come in.”</p>

<p>I had expected a shoddy, disordered interior. The little
apartment was immaculate; flower-boxes, red and white
geraniums at the balcony which gave on a garden; neatness,
order, charm. I sat, asking no questions,&mdash;puzzled.
Was it from love of the man, or from the denied natural
instinct towards home-building? Toinon served the dinner,
which she had cooked herself; hesitated and then, at
a sign from Alan, sat down with us. When Alan left
the room she turned to me and said, in a warning voice:
“He is very ill.”</p>

<p>Down the hall I heard him coughing.</p>

<p>“How ill?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Does he realize&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“No, no.”</p>

<p>Dinner over, she cleared the table deftly and converted
the room into a salon, brought the tisane to her
invalid, lit our cigars and, drawing up her chair before
the fire, began to crochet. But, all at once, looking up,
she said:</p>

<p>“If you’d rather be alone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>“Stay, of course.”</p>

<p>I, studying the end of my cigar, waited, feeling his
defiant glance on me.</p>

<p>“Shocked?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“You always were sanctimonious when it was a question
of doing things openly.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t come here to quarrel,” I said, smiling. His
characterization at the moment struck me as grotesque.
So far, we had barely skimmed the surface of things, and
I felt the underlying hostility of his attitude. Resolving
to take the bull by the horns, I said:</p>

<p>“Alan, before we bury the past, as I hope we’ll do, I
want to tell you that I blame myself. I was unjust; we
were all unjust to you. I regret it with all my heart.”</p>

<p>He stared at me, as a man grudging to relinquish his
advantage.</p>

<p>“What good will that do&mdash;now?”</p>

<p>“You are right. It can do no good&mdash;now. But we
can’t talk as man to man until we’ve had it out. So now
you know how I feel. As for the rest&mdash;I’ve done a lot
of things, been a bigger fool than you’ve ever been,
so, your adjective doesn’t apply.”</p>

<p>He looked at me quizzically.</p>

<p>“You’ve changed; changed a lot! You talk like a
two-fisted man. How long have you been away from
that precious family of ours?”</p>

<p>“About five years.” I drew a letter from my pocket.
“It was through Molly I heard of you.”</p>

<p>His face softened. “The one human being in the
family.”</p>

<p>“And Rossie, Alan.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,&mdash;Rossie,” he said hastily. “Had he lived&mdash;but
he didn’t. Great God! What a family! As
much human affection as you can squeeze out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
hind foot of a horsefly! You&mdash;you were one of them,
but I&mdash;God knows why&mdash;I was different. I was
stifling in that atmosphere of smug egotism.” His voice
rose as his face set in anger. The girl looked up from
her knitting and then at me, anxiously, but I knew that
it was better for him to give play to the pent-up grievances
of years. “I was stifling. I tell you&mdash;starved! A home?
A mockery! A gallery of granite statues. I can’t remember
one single time having known what it was to
have a father or mother. I never knew a word of sympathy,
a look of love. You made me believe I was a
lost soul&mdash;a gallows bird&mdash;you made me believe it
myself! Why? Because I had warm blood in my veins,
because I was human, had imagination, ambition, wild
animal force. I, who was worth the whole lot of you,
you crushed out with your cold, damned superiority,
your conventionality and your pride in yourselves. And
now, you come here and acknowledge you were wrong!
Sublime!”</p>

<p>“We were wrong.”</p>

<p>“Wrong? Can you give me back these ten years?
Can you make me what I should have been? Great
heavens, this decent little devil here has got more of a
woman’s heart to her when she brings me my medicine
than the whole blooming lot of you ever dreamed of!”</p>

<p>Toinon, who only half understood, looked up.</p>

<p>“What are you saying about me, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>?”</p>

<p>“Only good things, and only half of what you deserve,”
he said, laying his hand on her shoulder. He sat down,
exhausted, and leaning over, buried his head in his
hands.</p>

<p>“Now, you know what I think, what I shall always
think. At that, though I hate it all&mdash;your narrowness
and priggishness and holier-than-thou attitude&mdash;you’ve
left your confounded Littledale pride in me. I <i>am</i> one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
of you, under my skin, or else I’d marry the only human
being&mdash;” He stopped, looked at me and shrugged his
shoulders. “Don’t worry. I won’t. Give me Molly’s
letter.”</p>

<p>When he came to a part that told of my father’s ill
health, he frowned and looked up. “That’s why you’ve
come round, is it?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“To take me back with you&mdash;grand reconciliation&mdash;prodigal
son&mdash;and all that sort of stuff?”</p>

<p>“I had no such thought,” I answered warmly. “As a
matter of fact, I am not going myself.”</p>

<p>“You’re not?” He looked at me, too sharply for comfort.
“Why not? Easiest thing in the world for you to
get leave in your condition.”</p>

<p>“I want to get back to the Legion,” I said, looking
away.</p>

<p>He saw there was more than I wished to say and probably
he ascribed it to a different reason for, the letter
read, his manner changed, and he said:</p>

<p>“Looks bad for the Governor. Well, I’ve nothing
against him. A good sort, in his way, and as he saw;
a civilization that passes away with the rising flood.
Good sort&mdash;but utterly without significance. No&mdash;I
won’t go back. What a farce&mdash;to play the prodigal son!
Why, Davy, I’ve <i>lived</i>! You haven’t, none of you has.
I’ve lived&mdash;I’ve seen&mdash;I’ve been down in the depths
and seen! And you’ve gone on playing at being eighteenth
century Littledales, and never realizing that you
don’t count! You don’t even realize what America&mdash;the
new America&mdash;is!”</p>

<p>“I think I suspect it,” I said, surprised at the turn of
the conversation. I had come, I think, rather patronizingly,
and I found myself yielding to a mental supremacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>“Your kind still believes in government by individuals;
you can’t even see what’s coming. It’s mass that counts,
to-day. I don’t say ‘majorities’: the world has always
been governed by organized minorities, and it always
will be. You don’t know your generation; I do; I’ve been
one of them. I know what’s coming!”</p>

<p>“You don’t think much of our generation, I gather,”
said I, startled at the way his thought had run with mine.</p>

<p>“Of the generation of our kind? Precious little!”</p>

<p>“Well, Alan&mdash;that’s about my way of thinking.”</p>

<p>“Honest?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” I said, amused.</p>

<p>“What’s happened to you?” he said, pulling at his chin.
“Aren’t you satisfied with being a Littledale, with a Harvard
accent, and a number of good clubs, and parading
up and down this private preserve God made for you?
You haven’t lost faith in your Divine right of being a
Littledale? Good God&mdash;he has!”</p>

<p>We broke out laughing and, leaning over, struck hands
with a resounding clap.</p>

<p>“Davy, damned if I expected this!”</p>

<p>“Well, Alan, you’ve been knocking round one way.
I’ve knocked round another: between us we must have
gone up and down the scale,” I said, settling back.
“Well, what have you gotten out of it, and what do you
think of this funny old world of ours?”</p>

<p>He looked at me a long moment, still a little suspicious
of me.</p>

<p>“I enjoy it,” he said, to my surprise.</p>

<p>“Really? As for me, I’ve had about everything I
started with knocked into a cocked hat.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s hope&mdash;so long as you cling to some sort
of code.”</p>

<p>“Wonder if I do.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t there some things that you wouldn’t do, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
matter what happened? You wouldn’t forge&mdash;or
cheat&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, hardly.”</p>

<p>“Well, David, that’s moral. Suppose my ideas shock
you. They do most persons. You asked just now what
I’ve picked up these ten years. That’s about the most
important,&mdash;judging men by their codes. A man who’s
got a code of morals is moral, whether he’s a libertine,
a horse thief or&mdash;a minister. We start with about a
hundred and fifty inhibitions that are poured into our
ears; we end with about five or six fences which, no
matter what happens, we won’t cross.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get you.”</p>

<p>“Take your man of the world, who considers every
woman fair game; go further down; take one who’ll think
nothing of taking a woman to pay his debts, use one
woman to pay what he gives another; yet there are certain
things he won’t do. He won’t cheat at cards. That’s
a code. Take your criminal type. If there is something
stops him somewhere&mdash;say that it’s only going to the
gallows without ‘peaching’ on a friend&mdash;that’s a code,&mdash;his
code of morals, and, by that, he’s moral!”</p>

<p>“You’re not serious,” I said, laughing.</p>

<p>“Never more so. Think me crazy&mdash;wild&mdash;eccentric&mdash;anything
you want. I’m looking from the bottom up
towards your top-heavy society and your morality, and
I tell you that it’s only the man who won’t stop at anything,
who’ll cheat, lie, steal, seduce a young girl, traffic
in women&mdash;a man incapable of a code&mdash;that is absolutely,
hopelessly immoral. Look here; you’re still looking
at things from a moral point of view; you can’t help
it. I’m just looking on&mdash;recognizing things as they are&mdash;interested
in the human game. You think I’m crazy,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Frankly&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>“You think I’m bitter&mdash;a rebel&mdash;my head against
everything. Perhaps so; once, very much so. Not now.
Fact, I’m rather more of an optimist than you. If we
got down to it, you’d find I had a better opinion of mankind
than you.”</p>

<p>The excitement into which his defence of himself had
worked him started a coughing fit. Toinon came in and
looked at me in warning. I rose immediately, holding
out my hand.</p>

<p>“Well, Alan, I don’t have to agree with you, do I, to
say that I’m honestly glad to talk to you?”</p>

<p>“No, no, of course not. I’m a queer dick, probably,
but I’ve got reasons for what I think. Don’t ask questions,
if you don’t want my answers.” He touched the
decorations I wore and said, “I’m human enough, though,
to be glad you’re wearing those. Picked up a couple myself,
with the Canadians.”</p>

<p>“We never heard&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I was under an assumed name. Tell them at home
about it when you write.”</p>

<p>“Alan, there’s one thing,” I said, voicing a thought
that had been uppermost in my mind, “one thing I have
a right to know&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, go along with you. Of course, you’d have to say
the obvious thing,” he said, slapping me on the shoulder.
“I’m well fixed. Thanks just the same. And don’t worry
about me; I’m picking up amazingly. Come again.
Come again, soon.”</p>

<p>He went off into the back room, that I might not hear
his coughing.</p>

<p>“Is he any better?” I asked of Toinon, who had followed
me to the door.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Gas&mdash;at Neuve Chapelle.”</p>

<p>“No hope?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>“He is condemned.”</p>

<p>I stood, moodily incredulous, unable to believe that
beneath the vital activity of the brain the inevitable, relentless
contagion was working in the body. Then I
tried to thank her but made a sad botch of it.</p>

<p>“Whatever happens, Toinon,” I said, giving her my
address, “remember that I shan’t forget what you’ve done.
I shall see that&mdash;” She looked at me, so suddenly and
so straight that I floundered and stopped. “I meant if
ever you were in need&mdash;” Still she kept her eyes directly
on mine, disdaining a reply and, under that look I stammered:
“Forgive me. I’m an ass&mdash;but it was kindly
meant.”</p>

<p>Then, not knowing what to do, I took off my hat and
made her an absurdly exaggerated bow. She shrugged
her shoulders and closed the door. Which was no more
than I deserved.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>At the hotel I found a card from Stephen Brinsmade,
offering me a rendezvous for the next day. I wonder if
he is behind this transfer to Paris, and what it means?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I have set down as nearly as I can remember the circumstances
of my first meeting with my brother after
the lapse of years. I do not pretend to judge him for I
am not in the mood to formulate judgments. I only know
that a great new current of thought flowed into my mind
and that I felt an eagerness to encounter again the opposition
of his strangely antagonistic and dispassionate
mind. As for Toinon, I don’t pretend to sentimentalize
her kind. In my experience nothing is further from the
truth than the Marguerite Gauthiers of fiction.</p>

<p>The war, after a brief period of the hysterical emotionalism
of mob psychology, has shaken down society
into much the same order as before. The rear has its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
pagan side, a revulsion to life, a frantic determination
to eat, drink and be merry under the shadow of to-morrow’s
realism. There is an outward sobriety and a
decent respect for the black democracy of sorrow. Below
the surface, revelry is as <i>macabre</i> as ever, for it must
compress the passions of a lifetime into a span of hours,
and laughter is the hunger for unrealities. A few of
Toinon’s class&mdash;a very few&mdash;have turned Magdalene,
some genuinely impelled to service, most of them swayed
by a new dramatic loyalty to some man who brings them
the new sensations of heroic love.</p>

<p>There is nothing sentimental about Toinon. She is a
realist who looks life steadily in the face. Yet she, too,
has her code, as Alan would have said.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>IX</h3>

<p>I am going back to America. I am going home! It
has all come about so quickly that I hardly know what I
feel. If it were not for the inevitable meeting with
Letty&mdash;At the very thought everything in me rebels:
rather an exile of ten years than the hideous mockery of
that confrontation! Yet I am no longer a free agent; a
superior destiny is directing all my movements. To what
end? For there is no choice; my father has had a stroke
and I have been sent for. In my present condition there
is no excuse that I can offer. America! Home! Despite
even the ominous shadow that awaits me there, I feel
everything in me palpitating at the prospect. I sail from
Bordeaux in three days, with Mr. Brinsmade.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>As I had begun to suspect, Mr. Brinsmade has been the
quickening finger in my transfer here. Yet I cannot reproach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
him, given the end in view,&mdash;though at first,
when he announced that he had secured me my
leave, I was inclined in my pride to be a little resentful.
Of course, being the legal representative of the great
banking house of Gunther and Son, purchasing agents
in America for the French Government, a hint from him
is all that is necessary. When you reach the inner circle
of government you find always a very practical realism,
and Brinsmade is in all things a realist. Yet, there is
another side to him.</p>

<p>I think I admire him genuinely as much as any man I
know. He is utterly free from cant or pretense. He is
an idealist with an objective mind. When I talk with
him, I feel that I am building my philosophies on the safe
ground of things as they are. His knowledge of men and
their motives is stupendous. He is privileged to pass in
the corridors of the human opera, and though his knowledge
gained of the dark places might form another to
cynicism,&mdash;not so Brinsmade. His mental attitude is
like his physical aspect,&mdash;genial, tolerant, unhurried,
strong, not through bluster but by the authority of his
knowledge and experience. The war has waked in him
the desire for bigger things in America. He says so
frankly, and this new hunger in him, so close to my own
awakening, promises to be a great intellectual stimulus
to me on the trip over. There is no misunderstanding the
quality of his affection for me. I seem suddenly lifted
out of a drear monotony of unchanging days, back to a
life of extraordinary vitality and promise.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Saw my old friend, Maurice Plessis de Saint Omer. I
should not have known him. All the dandy is gone, the
feminine languor and grace sloughed off, and from underneath
has emerged the grim, unyielding granite of a race
of warriors. He is commandant in a regiment of dragoons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
and decorated with every honor. The mortality in his
family has been fearful, but he dismisses it quickly.</p>

<p>“Nothing matters,&mdash;except France!”</p>

<p>His optimism is that of absolute faith. I can imagine
how his men must adore him.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Said good-by to Alan,&mdash;a stiff, unsatisfactory parting,
in which we acted like puppets, rather than human beings.
But that is the Anglo-Saxon of it. He gave me his decoration,
to put in father’s hand, and immediately began
to joke about the family fetiches, our cave-dweller’s point
of view, etc., but I think it was to cover up his emotion.
He hates sentimentality.</p>

<p>“Good-by, then&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Good-by.”</p>

<p>We had separated as though it were the most casual
parting in the world. I wonder if I shall see him again.</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>Bordeaux</i></p>

<p>My last night on the soil of France. To-morrow I
leave for America, and for a brief, incredible two months
go back into the life that was once mine, but which to-night
is incomprehensible, strange and unreal. I am
writing in a little bedroom of the Hotel de l’Europe, fitfully
awake, and stirred at the thought of the change as
I never had believed possible. I don’t quite know this
sudden self that is come so imperiously into my mood.
I am older by a dozen years than this morning,&mdash;and by
a mental decision that I feel deep down in my heart has
been made. To-night I believe has brought a crisis in
my life. I am not quite sure of my motives; I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
know that I wish to examine them too closely. But to-night
the old rebellion against the obvious in life has
somehow left me. I am conscious of a new point of view.
Acceptance of life, a middle-age philosophy, a yielding
to safe currents? Yes, all of these and, perhaps, most of
all, just an overpowering homesickness,&mdash;the cry in my
heart to be back among my own kind. For all of which
I have Mr. Brinsmade to thank and the strangest of
strange confidences.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It began quite naturally and I had not the slightest suspicion
of any serious purpose. We were dining in a
papier-maché grotto of the celebrated Chapon Fin when,
in the midst of the meal, he looked over at me and said
abruptly:</p>

<p>“David, ever thought of getting out of the service?”</p>

<p>The question took me by surprise, coming so close to
thoughts that had haunted me for weeks.</p>

<p>“At times, when I get the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cafard</i>,” I admitted. “Every
one does.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been in the Legion?”</p>

<p>“Over two years, now. There isn’t much of the glamor
left, sir. It gets to be a long drag without much light
ahead.” A little regretful of my frankness, I sought to
justify myself. “You see, I went into it from the spirit
of adventure; it was a man’s job. I don’t say it wasn’t
also from love of the French. You couldn’t have seen
that mobilization and not have felt a thrill. Then&mdash;you
do hate a bully. At bottom, though, it was the
adventure,&mdash;the biggest thing that had ever happened
in the world. You couldn’t be there and keep out of it.”</p>

<p>“But now&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Now the thrill is gone,” I admitted. “It’s grim plugging,
not much fireworks or new business. When you’ve
seen Verdun&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“When you’ve gone through that,” I said, frowning at
the starting memories of that inferno, “it takes it out of
you.”</p>

<p>“It ages you&mdash;” he interrupted, looking at me.</p>

<p>“It’s hideous&mdash;horrible. I wake up at night even now
and then and feel myself back in it. You can’t imagine
it. I can’t describe it. You go in because you’re a soldier
and a man,&mdash;that’s all. You expect to die&mdash;you
know you’re going to die; all there is to it is a blind
rage for killing and a prayer to die quickly when it
comes.”</p>

<p>My hand was trembling and my eyes must have taken
on that strange far-off glaze which we bring back out of
battle, for he stopped me with a sudden grip on my arm.</p>

<p>“Here! That’s doing you no good. We’ll talk of
other things.”</p>

<p>I looked at my hand, which was shaking, and feeling
an attack of nerves impending, I rose hurriedly and left
the room.</p>

<p>“It takes you like that,” I said, when I had fought it
out and returned. “I’m sorry. I’m much better now. I
don’t get it often.”</p>

<p>He looked at me gravely.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, man! Are you going back in that
condition?”</p>

<p>“It won’t take a month to get me in shape.”</p>

<p>“It still attracts you?”</p>

<p>“I hate it.”</p>

<p>“Why, then?”</p>

<p>“Because,” I said, shrugging my shoulders, “because I
hate this other thing more,&mdash;this sitting out of it, when
real men are doing!”</p>

<p>He hesitated, and then leaned forward.</p>

<p>“David, if you ever make up your mind&mdash;if you feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
you need a longer time to pull yourself together&mdash;or if
you want to get out&mdash;let me know. That’s all.”</p>

<p>This hurt more than he could understand, and my answer
must have been brusque, for though he spoke out of
affection for me, he deserved it.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. Brinsmade, I don’t want things done
that way.”</p>

<p>“I only meant&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but there’s too much of that, already.
Question of pride; that’s all.”</p>

<p>He was tactful enough not to insist and turned the
conversation. Towards the end of the dinner, and a
magnificent bottle of Château Margot 1896, he said to me:</p>

<p>“David, you are a hard man to talk to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no&mdash;if you talk directly.”</p>

<p>“All right: suppose I do. Let’s talk about Anne.”</p>

<p>“About Anne!” I exclaimed, taken off my guard.</p>

<p>“Suppose I should tell you, point-blank, I want you
for my son-in-law? Well, what astonishes you? My
frankness?”</p>

<p>“Why sir, it’s very kind of you,” I began lamely, “but,
Anne&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. As to Anne,&mdash;I’m convinced she cares,
always has cared,” he said, leaning forward. “I know
something happened. I don’t know whether you want
to talk about it. Really, I should appreciate&mdash;”</p>

<p>The interview had taken such an extraordinary turn
that I found myself, without surprise, answering:</p>

<p>“Mr. Brinsmade, quite frankly, I am not in love with
Anne.”</p>

<p>“I know that now, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Once, for a time,&mdash;yes, I thought so. But neither
of us had the right to be thinking of such things, then. It
was a boy and girl affair.”</p>

<p>“Quite sure that was all?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>“Quite. The trouble was I showed her what I felt, or
thought I felt, and from that came the inevitable complication
and misunderstanding. We were both very stubborn.
Mr. Brinsmade, there’s another thing, since we’re
speaking plainly,” I added, suddenly impelled to frankness.
“Do you realize that in these years many things
have come into my life? I wonder if you would feel as
you do&mdash;”</p>

<p>“David, you have been tried; that shows in your face,”
he said, looking at me keenly. “I have been a young man
myself, and I don’t pretend to misunderstand you. Perhaps
this is unfair to you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mr. Brinsmade, there was a woman&mdash;I almost went
on the rocks two years ago,” I said abruptly, and immediately
regretted it.</p>

<p>“Are you your own master to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;thank God.”</p>

<p>“Absolutely certain?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p>“That’s all I want to know,” he said, as though satisfied
by the estimate of his own eyes. “I appreciate your
confidence, and like you for it. I’m not partisan for
the wild oats theory but, sometimes, when you’ve been
through the mill, it does leave you with a sense of values.”
Our eyes met, and each nodded in silent comprehension.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s go on. Was there ever a question of pride
in it&mdash;on your side?”</p>

<p>“Frankly and naturally, yes. I have no intention of
going through life on my wife’s pocketbook.”</p>

<p>“Good. Now the decks are cleared. As I thought.
You’ve been frank. So’ll I. Take up this question of
money. What is money? Opportunity. If men like
yourself, who have ideas, energy, and ambition, refuse
to take the opportunity money offers you,&mdash;who profits?
Some well-groomed little parasite who will loaf through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
life genteelly until the day when the real people rise and
take it away from him. And quite right, I say. And that
is what I don’t intend to have for my daughter.” He
cited names of men, men in public life of our acquaintance,
whose start in life had been facilitated by the fortunes
of their wives. “Look at it from my point of view.
I’ve made what I’ve made, and I want it to count in this
world. David, what do you intend to do in life?”</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p>“Fight through the war.”</p>

<p>“But, after?”</p>

<p>“After!” I said incredulously. “I may take up the
study of architecture again, unless&mdash;unless I am able to
do what I really want,&mdash;which is to write.”</p>

<p>“So I supposed. Don’t decide quickly. The current
is all the other way. We are a country of action, and
you’ve got that in you. I don’t make mistakes in men.
The real Americans are not those who sit and meditate;
they are those who are laying the foundations. Write?
What is the future? Deceptions. You know I’m not a
low-brow, as they say. Every night, before I go to sleep,
I read an hour in Balzac. Books are half my life, so
what I say to you I say without narrowness. But what
are our writers to-day? The servants of a great public
that wants to be amused, diverted in moments of relaxation;
a great mass that is striving, combating, contending,&mdash;a
public of children. Is that all you want to do?
Amuse them? Write for yourself: you’ll be over their
heads&mdash;misunderstood&mdash;if not ridiculed! The current
is against you. We move rapidly, and we read rapidly;
a moment to laugh or dream, as we read on the train.
Hard for you,&mdash;yes, but what do individuals count,
to-day?” He laid his hand on my arm. “Commerce,
science, public affairs. You like a man’s job. That’s
where it lies, and it’s our kind that must lead. Jump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
into the fight. Wealth and education are not only opportunities
but responsibilities: that’s what we must understand.
I said I want you as my son-in-law, Davy. It’s
more than that: I want to invest what I’ve made in a
man that counts. I want you with me. I want to feel
when it comes time for me to step out that I’m passing on
the power to count for big things to some leadership I’ve
inspired.”</p>

<p>He talked some while in this strain and, despite myself,
I felt myself yielding to his persuasion. Brinsmade is not
a selfish man. Among his own friends he was looked at
rather askance for his progressive tendencies. I found
myself thinking, with pride, “Here is a man, thoroughly
American, who has a sentiment of nationality; who does
not look at life from a detached point of view but has a
sense of being one in a multitude with a higher loyalty
than his own interests&mdash;loyalty to the name he bears&mdash;and
a pride in the America that will come!”</p>

<p>I think he saw the effect he had produced on me and,
shrewd lawyer that he was, he did not insist. I left
him, exceedingly flattered and already inclined to the
pleasant ways he opened to me.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Just why I should feel any compunction is the thing
that surprises me, now. Yet I do feel,&mdash;well, if not
compunction, a little uneasiness. After all, up to now,
whatever I have done has been done impulsively, without
a second thought as to the advantages or disadvantages to
me. This is another thing. For the first time, I am
looking on life with a middle-aged estimating of values,&mdash;and
to-night is like a valedictory to a youth that has fled.</p>

<p>In one way I almost resent the very frankness of his
discussion with me. For now I am somehow uneasily
conscious that there must be a certain grim deliberation
about my future conduct. And I ask myself again, “Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
this a new phase of life into which I have entered,&mdash;a
new milestone left behind?”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There are other things which haunt me. I know that
with Brinsmade’s influence with the French Government
it would be an easy thing for him to procure my discharge
and, under the circumstances, with my past record and
my present condition, who could criticize me? I have
the feeling that this is in the back of his mind, and looking
ahead and wondering what may happen when I meet
Anne again, I cannot help wondering if to-night I am not
stepping out from the bonds which have forged my destiny
here to a foreign land, to those whose every
thought and action is strange to my traditions. The
thing is so obvious I cannot avoid facing it. If only it had
come unperceived and by hidden ways: would it have
been easier for my pride and my self-respect?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The trouble is that during my convalescence I have
been aware that the terrific strain on my physical energy
has left a moral inclination towards the easy way through
the future. This physical and moral vitality in us is of
course inseparable. I have noticed that as men’s bodies
grow old a tolerance of social laxities comes with it.
Women in moments of physical exhaustion are most
vulnerable. The effect of shell-shock on the moral fabric,
even in officers of the highest character, is well known.
And then, there is something else. Comrades of mine,
who have fought with me with unimaginable bravery, return
from death with the feeling that they have spent all
their vital energy and looking to society to assure their
future, as a right acquired.</p>

<p>To-night I feel old, with the sense of duty accomplished.
I have done quite enough, I tell myself, in my
passage through the inferno of war. If now, when opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
offers, it pleases me to dispense with the bruising
struggle for existence, who has the right to judge of my
actions? Certainly not those who have not dared what I
have dared.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>All this is really rather morbid: both my will and my
body have given beyond their strength and are still convalescent,
or I should not be troubled with such sickly
doubts. Well&mdash;who knows? Is this a mood, or a
decision? To-night, frankly, I feel I have done enough
to have earned my right to rest. Let others do their part.
Milestone Number 4.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l1"><i>December</i></span><br />
<i>Littledale</i>
</p>

<p>Almost three weeks have passed since I last wrote
a line in this book,&mdash;three weeks crowded with events
which have turned the current of my life into ways of
which I never dreamed. I am here, in my old room,
a log fire snapping in the fireplace, the window sills
banked with snow, and the clock on the landing below
has rung eleven times. I have sat before these written
pages a full half-hour, tempted to destroy all,&mdash;yielding
to the sense of the futility in my life. Has it been but
three weeks since the night I sat and listened to Brinsmade
in the Chapon Fin at Bordeaux? To-day every
logical consideration is scattered to the winds as I realize
with an acute pain what sport we are in the veiled hands
of chance. Into my life has come the greatest exaltation
and the greatest emptiness, so inextricably interwoven
that I know not what to name it, pleasure or pain,&mdash;this
emotion which has imprisoned all my faculties with the
sudden awakening of a great love.</p>

<p>I do not know that I shall ever see her again; I have
given my promise never to seek her out. Why? I do
not know. Simply because, for her own reasons, she implored
it of me, and to her slightest wish I would be as
powerless to offer opposition as to consciously give her
physical pain. I have spoken of the mystery of good and
evil that is in each of us. To-day it is a mystery more
baffling than ever. As I look back now, what I marvel
at most is that I should have met Bernoline at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
very moment when I had so complacently, in my
worldly wisdom, accepted the easy path held open to me.
Two women will ever remain before me as the embodiment
of the twin contending mysteries in my soul: Letty,
who stands as the sinister embodiment of all those fierce,
primal instincts which in civilization we name evil; and
Bernoline, who has reached deep into the hidden needs
of which I was ignorant and revealed to me a self I did
not know,&mdash;a self against whose imperious idealism I
rebel, but a self which will, to the end of my days, dominate
me and determine my actions. One has vanished
into the wilderness of men, and the other returns, a
sinister memory, which is a cross to be borne day by day,
behind a mask that must forever stand between me and
my brother.</p>

<p>At Bordeaux I had but explored the mystery of evil;
the mystery of good was still unknown to me.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>As I look back now, every word, every object, every
outline is clear to me from the first instant of our meeting.
It is as though with the sudden stirring of my
deeper nature every little sense awoke. There are colors,
the oranges in a straw basket, the blue of a porter on the
dock, the gray whirl of her scarf against the blue Breton
cape on the upper deck as we passed out of France, the
red luxury of the sunset that swam over our heads that
last day at sea,&mdash;all these tints and a dozen others are
associated in the minutest visualization along with the
scent of tarred ropes about us at Bordeaux, the clean
brine of the sea which held us ten unforgettable days, the
sound of the forecastle bell tolling off the hours, and the
light, slipping step which I would know to-day from a
thousand others.</p>

<p>It was in the wet dawn of late November that I first
saw her, and the memory starts up before my eyes, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
to the most irrelevant details. I can see again the moist
dock, the gray flanks of the ocean liner shutting out the
sky, the masts dissolving in the morning mist and the
white splotches of faces flowering against the rails. The
salt, tarred smell of the sea is still in my nostrils and I
am back in the crowd of leave-takers, saying the last
broken farewells; an old couple clinging to their son, a
sailor with his sweetheart. Boatswains are piping, cabmen
swearing, loiterers gazing; a smirched face looms as
a little wharf rat bumps against me, and&mdash;I look up
and see her again&mdash;as I saw her for the first time.</p>

<p>She stood heavily veiled, her arm about an old servant
in a Breton cap, who was weeping her heart out,&mdash;a
very old woman, wrinkled and stooped, whose lips
trembled, whose eyes never ceased their staring intentness.
It was not simply grief at parting, often hysterical
in servants, but something inexpressibly deeper; not so
much a protest as a final resignation to a weight of sorrow
beyond old age’s power to bear.</p>

<p>At this moment, her young mistress lifted her veil and,
as she bent forward to kiss each shriveled cheek, I saw
her face out of the mist and the blurred crowd&mdash;as I
see it now&mdash;and no second glance could ever add to that
instant conviction. The whistle blew above us. The
old woman cried something hysterically and caught the
young hand to her lips. I heard her murmur a blessing,
I saw her try to disengage her hand, and then as, helplessly,
she sought for assistance, her look met mine. I
know that my eyes were dim. She saw and trusted them.
I stepped forward, bare-headed.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Permettez&mdash;Madame?</i>”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Merci, Monsieur&mdash;vous êtes bien bon.</i>”</p>

<p>The veil dropped again. I put my hand under the old
woman’s arm and drew her slowly away. When I returned,
her young mistress was already on the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>I do not know that I can describe her, for when I see
her face I see only the eyes, dark, round and big, without
guile or artifice, eyes that were open and luminous,
and yet eyes that were stricken with a suffering too deep
to be cast off in tears. It was not what I saw but what
I felt,&mdash;the inner quality, the sweet dignity, the gentleness
and the high aristocracy. Women, before, had been
to me types. In her, instantly, I discerned a being set
apart, whose choice of action could never proceed from
feminine acceptance of the hour’s fashion in dress,
thought and standards. She was what she was, and would
go forward always along her clear path, undisturbed by
the troubling blast of the popular wind. I knew that for
the first time I had looked into eyes which no ugliness,
no meanness, no unworthy thought could ever trouble, and
that I was of the privileged of the world to have seen
her. One look, a look that might pass a thousand times&mdash;one
look in the mists of the dawn, in the scrambling,
shoddy crowd&mdash;and yet, for that one instant’s fugitive
understanding, all that I had been and was became as
nothing, and my destiny&mdash;for better or worse, for ill
and pain and sorrow, emptiness and loneliness&mdash;was
irrevocably determined. Yes, mystery of the good and
evil that is in us! From the pain of evil, we struggle
back to sanity and clean air and memory covers over the
scar, but from the emptiness and the ache that, in the
mystery of good, love may lay upon our lives, what escape
or what answer is there?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Last night I left off when the memory was too acute
and my eyes could no longer see to write. To-night, I
come back to it, impatiently, with a longing to reclaim
every word, every look, every precious minute, and fix it
indelibly before me. The situation here is hideous. I
seem to be walking over a mine that sooner or later will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
go off, while I can do nothing but await the final catastrophe.
To write is to return to her, to hope again that
somehow, somewhere, without being false to my promise,
I shall see her again.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>II</h3>

<p>The gangplank swung out as I stepped on the deck,
the air shrilling with the chirp of whistles and the creak
of pulleys. I shouldered through the motley crowd and
joined Mr. Brinsmade on the upper deck. I remember
how solemnly I looked down on the France I knew and
loved, and with what reluctant apprehension of the future
I watched the gray hawser stiffen.</p>

<p>“Strange, to be going?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;incredibly strange,” I said slowly. “I can’t
quite believe it; for whole months to be a free agent&mdash;no
longer a part of a great orderly machine, without
eyes or ears or will. I think I have forgotten what the
other world is like.”</p>

<p>“Do you regret this?”</p>

<p>“Regret it? Yes, it’s hard to leave a thing unfinished
when you’ve gone so far. And, though I’ve hated it
and cursed it, well, it is a different conception of
humanity, after all, this doing a thing as a mass. I’ve
accepted it, readjusted myself to it. I think it’s not the
question of liking it or not liking it; it’s the feeling of
the inevitable and the wanting to measure up to other
men. I stopped debating with myself the day I saw a
man at my side go to his death. He was a scullion out
of the kitchen of a New York hotel&mdash;Carlo Roger&mdash;deserter
and rascal. He could have remained, and no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
would have cared. He did his duty, unnoticed. I
couldn’t do less.”</p>

<p>I looked up, and then down, and added, “Better hold
on tight to me, Mr. Brinsmade. I feel like making a
jump for it.”</p>

<p>Laughing he passed his arm through mine and pretended
not to notice the dimness in my eyes.</p>

<p>“You’ve known humanity at its best, my boy,” he said.
“And I, thank God, have had a glimpse of it. And
when you’re like myself, a weather-worn old lawyer, who
walks behind the scenes, that’s something to be thankful
for. Well&mdash;if they’re not of our race&mdash;they’re the
same human beings: we can share that.”</p>

<p>“I feel that way.”</p>

<p>A group of ambulance drivers descended upon us, with
their fragmentary chatter.</p>

<p>“Boat in had a close shave.”</p>

<p>“Missed a torpedo by twenty feet.”</p>

<p>“Come off! Every one’s seeing submarines!”</p>

<p>“Hope we pick one up.”</p>

<p>“Say, what’s the matter with this boat?”</p>

<p>“Off for the good old U. S. A!”</p>

<p>A great blast of steam shook the air above us, sending
its wet vapors against our cheeks. The gangway swung
clear and rolled back on the dock. Another moment,
and the big ship trembled beneath our feet and slowly
and definitely veered out against the straining hawsers.</p>

<p>We left the noisy exuberance of the crowd and went
down the deck, in search of quieter moods.</p>

<p>“Here’s our spot.”</p>

<p>I followed Mr. Brinsmade and slipped between two lifeboats.
Then, abruptly, we stopped. The railing was
already tenanted by a young woman.</p>

<p>If she heard our exclamation she did not change from
the rigidity of her pose. We hesitated, moving to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
side, and lifted our hats in a sobered deference and, I
knew, through our minds flashed the same thought: she
was French and France was receding from her eyes.</p>

<p>One hawser still held us to the land, like a faint memory
stretching back into the past. Then a sudden hissing
contortion whipped over the widening waters. And so,
with the parting of that link, one chapter had ended for
me and another, that in the wildest flight of my imagination
I could never have divined, had begun.</p>

<p>Instinctively I raised my eyes and recognized my
chance acquaintance of the dock.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>She had fallen back against the life boat, arms rigidly
extended, holding the railing from her. A gray film
hid her features, wound about her neck and stood out in
a long flutter, a ripple of light against the dark unanimity
of her costume. Youth and sorrow are two great emotions
which cannot be disguised. I felt, despite the
rigidity of the body which told of the stricken soul, the
young grace and dignity. I hoped that she would notice
me, but she remained in staring oblivion. Yet, though
I had spoken but a half dozen words to her, I can remember
how keen was the sense of her presence at my
side and how, on the instant, I forgot my personal emotions
and seemed to be entering into the moods of the
woman whose first glance had brought me a sense of
intimacy.</p>

<p>I looked, and then I looked away, with a guilty consciousness
of trespassing on her grief. Yet, though my
glance was averted, I was looking back with her eyes.
My companion spoke to me: I did not hear.</p>

<p>I was thinking of the wrench of old affections for her&mdash;the
venture into the uncharted new&mdash;the fading of
the homeland that was in her heart by a thousand memories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>Below, the swift currents of the Garonne ran from us,
swift as the currents of time. Faces of blue-shirted
dock hands grew blurred. Flashes of red trousers, gray-blue
uniforms, brown and black of women’s dresses
merged into a momentary tapestry. The ungainly, lumbering
motor-boat, with a hulking colossus balanced at
the tiller, dropped behind. Blue-tiled roofs slipped away.
Cathedral spires came out against the horizon, like the
spoutings of huge sea monsters. The grassy shores flowed
back with the current. Wharves, factories, lean shipyards
with naked iron arms extended, tilted ships discharging
cargoes, brown vineyards combing the aged
slopes, tramp steamers in dusty garments, Swedish and
Greek, under the imperial banner of Britain, the Tricolor,
the Stars and Stripes; tubs, derelicts, old men of the
sea, reclaimed and pressed into service,&mdash;all the multiple,
incongruous aspects of war crowded about our passing,
and always that revelation of the human note, the swarming
sea adventurers, undaunted, incredulous of the odds,
contemptuous of man’s malignant genius for slaying man.</p>

<p>I hazarded another glance at my companion and, perceiving
her still oblivious to our presence, my glance
remained, my sympathies quickened by a hundred remembered
scenes of parting. I could not see her eyes
for the veil that hid them but, instinctively, I divined
the yearning of their backward look.</p>

<p>Heavens, how I knew that last look! How many
times, in crowded depot or passing train, I had seen on
the faces of women, dry-eyed and staring, that look of
the soul’s rebellion, the last renunciation, the last groping
for a final memory to bear down the lonely years. France,
land of her childhood and girlish dreams; France, of
precious sorrows and what affections: France, of her
long race and living prayers, was receding before the
weakening vision that rebelled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>“I say, Davy.”</p>

<p>I came to myself at the touch of Mr. Brinsmade’s hand.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we’ve a right here, do you?”</p>

<p>Then, and then only, I realized how profound had
been my absorption.</p>

<p>“No, no, guess you’re right.”</p>

<p>As we started to withdraw, a couple of sailors, preparing
to swing the lifeboats for the night’s perilous dash
into haunted seas, came shuffling up.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pardon, Messieurs.</i>”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;moving out.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pardon, Mamzelle.</i>”</p>

<p>The sailor hesitated, shuffled and touching his cap, repeated
his request, unnoticed. As he stood there awkwardly,
undecided, I stepped to her side, raising my hat.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pardon, Mademoiselle. Les matelots.</i>”</p>

<p>She turned, and I felt her staring blankly at us, as
though in the long blur of faces she were unable to separate
friends, acquaintances and enemies. But, immediately
perceiving the situation, she thanked me with a
little nod and turning, said:</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Je vous dérange&mdash;mil pardons.</i>”</p>

<p>There was a tired note in the modulated voice that I
remember to this day,&mdash;the weariness of too much
struggling.</p>

<p>From the sailors a chorus went up.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pas de quoi, Mamzelle!</i>”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ne vous donnez pas la peine.</i>”</p>

<p>They made way for her deferentially, fingers to their
caps, simple-hearted men, quick to feel and sure to
recognize the finer metal.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Merci, Messieurs.</i>”</p>

<p>A slight inclination of her head, and she had passed
down the deck to the further rail.</p>

<p>“I didn’t realize I was staring,” I blurted out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;a little too openly.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. It rather got me&mdash;took me back to the
mobilization, and the depots&mdash;the look on the faces of
the women; when you’ve seen it you can’t forget it.”</p>

<p>We moved to the rear and talked of desultory things,
as we hung on the rail and watched the steerage. Below,
a returning <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">permissionaire</i>, perched on a capstan, was
playing on a harmonica the defiant strains of “Sambre et
Meuse,” a group of cattlemen from a torpedoed ship,
stretched about him, basking in the sun. The martial
air quickened the blood in my veins. I saw a regiment
growing out of the mists of the morning, gaunt,
grim and proud, bandaged and limping, returning with
their memories from the trenches. I have seen many
a dress parade after battle and been thrilled; but I still
can remember that first knowledge of the living returning
from the dead to the rolling drums of the “Sambre et
Meuse.”</p>

<p>“I want to love my country like that,” I said suddenly.
“I want to get the same thrill when the regiment swings
up the street&mdash;” I broke off. “I don’t know just how
I’ll fit in. I’m afraid they won’t understand my way of
looking at things. I’m rather dreading the test.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get that thrill.”</p>

<p>“I wonder. We all seem to be pulling for ourselves:
liberty, individualism, yes; but real nationalism&mdash;the
thing that’s a religion&mdash;the thing you get over here&mdash;that
makes it worth while to die.”</p>

<p>“Wait until we understand.”</p>

<p>Some one in the khaki of a volunteer ambulance
hailed me.</p>

<p>“David Littledale, ’08. Remember me? Joe Hungerford.
Heard you were on board. What luck!”</p>

<p>I turned to shake hands. It was the same Joe Hungerford
of school and college days, lively and irrepressible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
a pink and white complexion, a mischief-loving eye, a
quick smile and a clear visage, incapable of wrong, deceit,
subtleties, or an unnecessary mental operation,&mdash;a
boy, as his nation was young.</p>

<p>“Who’d thought to run in on you, Big Dale? Glad
to meet you, Mr. Brinsmade. You know my father&mdash;Sam
Hungerford, of the Illinois Central? Quite a crowd
on board. Say, do you think there is any chance of our
sighting a submarine?”</p>

<p>“Same old Joe,” I said, laughing. “You wouldn’t feel
anything if you were being led out to be shot.”</p>

<p>“The devil I wouldn’t.” But, in the midst of a retort,
perceiving a familiar face below, he was off, with an exclamation:
“Hello! If there isn’t Frangipani! See you
later!”</p>

<p>“There’s your young America.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I assented. “And a pretty good sort, too. It
does everything but think. That sounds rather hard;
but that was what I was, three years ago.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was the feeling of the game, the bigger
game, that got you in it?”</p>

<p>“Frankly, yes; more or less. And that’s true of most
of us. Not all, though. But once in, we got a touch of
the other thing.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too quick to judge when you get over there,”
he said, divining my thoughts. “Public opinion is complex,
but there is one thing that decides America in the
end, always,&mdash;idealism. It’s a quality that is our weakness
and our salvation. It makes us the prey to quacks
and demagogues, until we learn to see through them.
But it is the air we breathe and no one can lead us long
away from it.”</p>

<p>“I say, Mr. Brinsmade,” I broke in, “don’t put me
down for the sort of expatriate who goes round damning
his country&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>“My dear David,” he said, laying his hand on my arm,
“don’t worry. I feel even more strongly than you do.
And it’s a big test that’s coming; make no mistake. It’s
our kind that’s failing, not America. Somehow, the class
that ought to lead, doesn’t.”</p>

<p>We separated on that, and I went down to arrange my
cabin, a little uncomfortable at what I had said, and
wondering if my listener had not been all the while smiling
tolerantly at my youthful pessimism,&mdash;for though I
am obstinate in my opinions, I do not express them easily
in conversation.</p>

<p>When I returned the early twilight was sifting in. I
went to the upper deck, with a vague feeling of uneasiness
which to this day I cannot explain. Invisible nets
descended between us and the fading world; the ship
itself, its masts and its traveling rails, was dissolving in
the flowing in of the dusk. I went directly to the rear,
and twenty feet away I saw her as I had expected, a blot
against the rail. She did not turn at my approach,
though we were alone on the creaking deck. Twice I
came to the railing at her side, hesitated and turned
away. She was there, like a statue of bereavement, oblivious
of all but the France that was now but the faint
iterated flashing of distant lights.</p>

<p>I do not know how long I continued there, pacing off
the deck under the swinging spaces of the night. All my
instincts urged me to her side, and all my education
warned me against the intrusion. I felt so keenly her
utter loneliness, the mysterious sense of some overwhelming
sorrow, the exhaustion of an unending struggle, that
twice, with some hasty phrase on my lips, I stopped, determined
to speak to her. But each time I turned away.
Yet, each time, I remember the angry rebellion that came
into my heart at the tyranny of convention which interposed
between us. Had she been a woman of the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>&mdash;how
easy it would have been! But she was not. She
was of my own kind, and convention dictated that I
should pass on and leave her there in the melancholy of
the damp night, eating out her heart.</p>

<p>What was it came to me at that moment? What inexplicable
intuition of danger? I had left her with a
feeling of my utter helplessness, when, with my hand on
the door, I stopped, looking out into the dark void, where
sea and sky had disappeared and but a single step led
into Infinity.</p>

<p>But a single step and such an easy step! Suddenly
I turned, went to her directly, and said:</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mademoiselle&mdash;pardon, Mademoiselle</i>; you must
not&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vous ne pouvez rester ici</i>.”</p>

<p>The emotion in my voice startled her. Her head
turned hastily; she swayed and leaned heavily on the rail.
I felt the stiffening of her body against the impertinence
of my intrusion, and all my assurance fled.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I do not think I understood you.”</p>

<p>She answered me slowly, in excellent English, with only
the slightest accent.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, humbly. Please don’t think I
mean to be impertinent,” I stammered back, “but I don’t
think it is good for you to stay up here&mdash;all alone.”</p>

<p>I felt how ridiculous this must have sounded, and broke
off lamely.</p>

<p>“By what right?”</p>

<p>“No right, Mademoiselle; just a human impulse, that’s
all&mdash;just the feeling that you are in great sorrow and
that you shouldn’t be left alone,&mdash;not here, at least. I
feel it very strongly, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, there are some sorrows that are sacred.”</p>

<p>The words, the accent, the suffering implied went to
my heart. I felt then as I have ever felt since the indefinable
superiority of her gentle nature over mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, I know that this may seem incomprehensible
to you; I have been walking here half an hour,
before I dared to speak to you, but&mdash;but I cannot go
away and leave you here alone.”</p>

<p>Saying which, I bowed and moved away a little distance
and took my station resolutely. Presently she
said:</p>

<p>“Monsieur&mdash;you will not leave me?”</p>

<p>“I cannot, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please go away; please leave me alone!”</p>

<p>Her voice broke and, as I hurried to her side, she put
her head suddenly down on her arms. A film of her veil
whipped by the wind caught my arm, and by this slender
bond I held her in my protection.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, I, too, am a soldier of France; I
have fought with your people: must I turn from one of
my own kind who, I know, is in distress, just because
of conventionality! You are in distress, and I know it.
Please let me judge for you at this moment. You must
not stay up here alone. I mean it.”</p>

<p>“But I want to be alone.”</p>

<p>It was the weak voice of a child that now fought
against me.</p>

<p>“I know I am right,” I said with difficulty, for
then, as ever, all my impulse was to do her bidding. But
it was the thought of the void without and that unseen
step that gave me courage to resist her. “I know how
impertinent this must seem to you. It is not meant that
way. Do believe that. You must go down on the lower
deck. You really must.”</p>

<p>She straightened up and there, cloaked by the night,
facing each other, our wills clashed. A moment&mdash;a
long moment&mdash;then, yielding, she turned and I followed
by her side. Halfway down the deck she stopped.</p>

<p>“Just a second.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>She leaned back against the lifeboat, her hand to her
throat.</p>

<p>“Now.”</p>

<p>I piloted her below and found her a chair near mine.
She suffered me to wrap her up without further objection.</p>

<p>“There are no lights to-night and all passengers are
ordered to spend the night on deck. You will be quite
alone here. Good-night and thank you.”</p>

<p>If she answered me I did not hear her. I left her purposely
and went aimlessly through the ship, with something
new and strange stirring in my brain.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>III</h3>

<p>I know now that I loved her from the first meeting of
our eyes. I did not realize it then nor for many days after.
The impulse that drew me to her was so imperious that I
yielded completely to it, without power of pausing to put
questions to myself.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>That night I was possessed of many conflicting emotions.
I was an American again after years of exile,
making contact with my own kind, accustoming my ear
to old accents, familiar phrases, forgotten bits of slang,
my heart warming with their exuberance, their youthful
spirits. Even the drummer by my side at the table,
nasal, rough and loquacious, was a type so comprehensible
that I found myself beaming with grateful pleasure
as he talked of “God’s country,” stretched for the hors
d’oeuvres, and addressed his neighbor as “Sonny.”</p>

<p>Supper was a hasty, scrambling meal, with the portholes
sealed. The crowd was oddly mixed, like a herd of refugees
arrived from an inundation; a score of young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
ambulance men returning, the gray-blue of a few French
officers, sailors and officers from torpedoed boats, crews
of cattle boats, commercial travelers, and those endless
rovers of the sea, dressmakers and journalists. The
conversation, freed by the sense of the abnormal, rose
about me without restriction.</p>

<p>“What are we stoppin’ down here for?”</p>

<p>“Moon’s coming up: waiting for it to cloud over.”</p>

<p>“Why that?”</p>

<p>“Clear moon’s what submarines like, lady. They can
see us, and we can’t see them.”</p>

<p>“That’s how they got us, second night out of Genoa,
just a ripple blowing, and full moon.”</p>

<p>“What were you in?”</p>

<p>“Three-master, carrying lumber&mdash;that we’d landed&mdash;return
voyage. Well, I ain’t got no kick coming. We
pulled off ten round trips, and the balance is on the right
side.”</p>

<p>“Torpedoed?”</p>

<p>“Yep&mdash;and sunk in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Spry work getting into boats?”</p>

<p>“Sure was.”</p>

<p>“All off?”</p>

<p>“Most of us.”</p>

<p>“Where was your section?”</p>

<p>“We were up in the Vosges.”</p>

<p>“Know Harrity?”</p>

<p>“He was down in Verdun with us.”</p>

<p>“That was rather hot, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Quite hot enough.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! I don’t believe there’s any danger,” said
a voice.</p>

<p>“If they sank us, it would mean war, sure.”</p>

<p>“That is, if it could be proved: and what chance
would there be of proving it, a night like this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>“Guess that’s sense, too; besides, there’s always a
chance at a mine.”</p>

<p>Joe Hungerford joined me as I left the table.</p>

<p>“Going to spend the night on deck?”</p>

<p>“It’s orders.”</p>

<p>A little moonlight had come filtering in between the
decks, as the heavy moon rolled up over the horizon. A
faint streak ran along the railing and touched the stanchions
with the luster of fallen snow. In the shadows we
could distinguish shapes stretched out on steamer chairs,
while others arrived, trailing life preservers and rugs,
with an occasional handbag.</p>

<p>“Quite a picnic.”</p>

<p>“Don’t like the children being around, Hungerford.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s not pleasant. If it weren’t for that,
wouldn’t mind having a run in with a submarine. Hello&mdash;sounds
like the anchor coming up.”</p>

<p>We mounted to the upper deck, under the open sky,
with its opalescent tints and shifting clouds to the west.
Red lights and green lights on ghostlike shadows dotted
the stretch of foggy water. Ahead, from the last sentinel
of the world underfoot, a shaft of light came whirling in
broken iteration,&mdash;like a can of fire that a small boy
whirls in the night. A group of sailors shuffled by. The
shrill of a whistle, the thrum of engines, and ahead the
whirling beacon crept around the bow and, returning,
slid down amidships. The door shot out its feeble ray
of light. A group from the smoking room crowded out
to witness the running of the channel. Then, a sudden
rise of voices.</p>

<p>“Well, bring on your submarines!”</p>

<p>“If they get us, I take my chances on deck.”</p>

<p>“You young fellows are mighty chipper; wait till you
get shaken up once.”</p>

<p>“Well, you got away, didn’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>“Gosh, with that light playing on us, anything ought
to hit us.”</p>

<p>“Back to the good old U. S. A., boys!”</p>

<p>“Well, enough scenery! Let’s start up a game!”</p>

<p>There was a laugh, and the crowd shuffled back to the
card room.</p>

<p>“Going to sit in, Littledale? It’s a good crowd.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, later.”</p>

<p>I went below, bundled up my great-coat, fished out a
couple of life preservers, and groped my way to my chair.
She was there as I had placed her, but in the black of
the deck I could not tell whether she was awake or
asleep. I hesitated a moment and then, slipping in, made
myself comfortable for the night.</p>

<p>Brinsmade at my right was struggling with a tinder
which refused to light.</p>

<p>“Have a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">briquet</i>,” said a voice.</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>The next moment the steel struck sparks and an odor
of burning tobacco filled the air. Slight as had been the
light it provoked remonstrances and down the deck the
plaint of a woman was heard.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why they allow such a thing as that!”</p>

<p>“No lights!”</p>

<p>“Put it out!”</p>

<p>“Good many persons seem unduly excited about submarines,”
said the voice of our neighbor, high-pitched,
pleasing, if not resonant.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;there’s always a risk.”</p>

<p>“Hardly. Germany doesn’t want us in the war.”</p>

<p>“Germany? Think so? From what I’ve seen of her,
she doesn’t care what we think or any one else&mdash;except
what she wants at the time.”</p>

<p>Our new acquaintance was silent a moment, as though
unwilling to venture too rapidly forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, thank God, we’re out of it!” he said, at last.
“The election settled that. If it had gone the other way,
there might be a little more excitement.”</p>

<p>“Pacifist?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence, broken at last by a question.</p>

<p>“Been over long?”</p>

<p>“Three months.”</p>

<p>“In France?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“So&mdash;and you still come back with those ideas?” said
Brinsmade’s bass voice, studiously polite but with a note
of criticism.</p>

<p>“Does that mean you’d have us in the war?” said the
other, in a tone which showed that he recognized the
criticism and resented it. “To pull the chestnuts out of
the fire for France and England?”</p>

<p>“Over on business?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t desire peace to keep on making money,”
answered the other, with a suavity which suggested a
smile. “I am a journalist. Suppose I’d better warn you&mdash;a
socialist; worse, still&mdash;the editor of <i>The Protest</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i>The Protest?</i> Yes, I read it,” said the other. “Then
you are Peter Magnus?”</p>

<p>“Now you know the worst.”</p>

<p>“Glad to know you. Well, I’m rather on the other
side. Stephen B. Brinsmade,&mdash;one of the unconvicted
rich, I suppose you’d call us.”</p>

<p>“Really? And you read <i>The Protest</i>?” said Magnus
in surprise. “May I ask why?”</p>

<p>“Why I read it? Certainly; to know what the other
side thinks.” He laughed, and continued with the good
humor men of politics use as a cloak but which in his
case was the complacency of success. “Honestly, I’m
glad to meet you, Magnus, and I look forward to talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
things over with you. That’s rather odd, for I suppose
we’ll get to hating each other cordially. However,
I’ll promise to keep my temper.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;that’s my experience. Men can meet in physical
combat and, the struggling over, sit down over a
friendly chop. They may fight each other with their
wits; as lawyers, blackguard each other in public for the
benefit of the unsuspecting jury, and retain a friendly
liking; but when it comes to a combat of ideas, we seem
to acquire a secret antipathy for the man who disagrees
with us.”</p>

<p>“That’s because the conflict of ideas is the most fundamental
and irrepressible of all conflicts,” said Magnus
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Quite right.” Brinsmade drew on his pipe until the
ashes reddened, outlining the fingers which screened it.
Then he began to whistle, softly, to himself, drawing in
his breath.</p>

<p>Outside, the lighthouse was sinking into the sea, while
the whirling beams continued to blazon the sky like
flashes of heat lightning. To the south a star swam out
from the horizon, swelled and glittered, as a new lighthouse
took up its warning. A rift of clouds spread over
the risen moon, obscuring the crested ripples that had
been following us. A patrol of sailors went heavily overhead,
to the sound of a dragging rope, the creak of a
pulley,&mdash;and through the hiss of cleft waters and the
whistle of the wind the thud of powerful engines shook
the decks.</p>

<p>“Feels like ‘Full Speed,’ Davy,” said Brinsmade.
“Guess we’re clear.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we’re convoyed. Well, anyhow, it’s clouded
over, and that’s a good thing. Hardly think there’s any
danger,” said Magnus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>“Neither did our friends on the <i>Lusitania</i>.” Brinsmade
changed the subject to one which had evidently been in
his mind. “So you’ve been over here in this hallowed
land three months, and you come back with the same
ideas you started with?”</p>

<p>“Only more so.”</p>

<p>“No offence. Most men I know have had their pre-conceived
ideas pretty badly shaken up. That’s my
own experience. Well&mdash;time enough to discuss all that.
Only&mdash;I’ll say this. Whatever you may think of war,
and I was a good deal of a pacifist, myself, to have
been over here, to see what this old world is capable of in
a crisis, gives me a better liking for my fellow man. I
haven’t always had a very affectionate regard for him.
But, by Jove, what I’ve seen of this people over here
makes me respect myself a little more just as a plain
human being!”</p>

<p>“You’re plumb right there, Mister, whoever you may
be!” said a voice back of us, a voice with the nasal
Yankee twang.</p>

<p>“It is glorious, I grant you,” said Magnus quietly.</p>

<p>“But useless?”</p>

<p>“Quite useless, because it accomplishes nothing
toward a final solution; but, of course, where we differ,
and, I suppose, in all arguments will come back to it, is
that I don’t admit the necessity of nationality.”</p>

<p>“That’s frank, and glad you mentioned it,” said Brinsmade,
with a certain joy. “For that is the one big thing
that has come out of the war, and it’s bigger than creed
or politics, Magnus. See what happened to your German
Socialists! It’s the rock on which you’ve split!”</p>

<p>“For the present, quite true,” said Magnus, “but it’s
the backbone of Socialism and, if we are not internationalists,
we are not Socialists.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>“Well&mdash;put it this way. You’ll agree that war is savagery,
and contrary to the spirit of civilization; in other
words, that what we are all seeking is a final and enduring
peace?”</p>

<p>“Two years ago I’d have agreed. Now, I’m not quite
so sure I do believe that is possible in our vision. However,
for the sake of argument, go on.”</p>

<p>“What is war? Competition. Competition of what?
Of rival nationalities. Seeking what? Commercial
aggrandizement&mdash;subjecting the many to benefit the few.
America, Germany, England, France have been at war
with each other commercially one hundred years. War is
only a commercial ultimatum, when a commercial tariff
is too slow. The trouble is, men are guided by their
sentiments to think nationally, instead of by their logic
to conceive of themselves as a world race.”</p>

<p>“You are a Jew, of course, Magnus?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“And proud of the history of your race?”</p>

<p>“I am exceedingly proud.”</p>

<p>“And rightfully. It is a wonderful race. But if it
had been guided by such theories as you now profess, it
would have disappeared centuries ago, like a drop of ink
in a barrel of water. Racial solidarity has been the immortality
of you Jews, and sometimes&mdash;no offence, Magnus&mdash;I’m
inclined to believe that the instinct that moves
many of your brilliant race into Socialism is a contempt
of mere national definitions which in your own world-solidarity
have no meaning to you.”</p>

<p>“The Jewish race is not socialistic,” said Magnus, with
a note of impatience.</p>

<p>“It is increasingly so, and most of its intellectuals are.”</p>

<p>“It was not a Jew, but William Lloyd Garrison, who
said ‘Our Country is the world.’”</p>

<p>“A fair rejoinder in a debate, but we are not appealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
to the applause of an audience, but, I take it, as two
men holding diametrically opposite opinions, honestly
seeking to find out what each believes.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Magnus, evidently favorably influenced
by the other’s good nature, for he answered more
frankly. “It is possibly true that the Jewish race is
most ready to embrace the principle of internationalism
on account of its past history. I will grant that. But
that does not affect the general proposition. Pacifism,
which is good Christianity, is the first step to internationalism,
and don’t forget that the most determined opponents
of militarism are of a Christian sect,&mdash;your
Quakers.”</p>

<p>“Two years ago,” said Brinsmade, carefully, “when I
called myself a pacifist, I might have denied that. By
pacifism then I meant opposition to war,&mdash;the belief in
the possibility of universal disarmament and settlement
of all difficulties by arbitration. But I never associated
that with internationalism.”</p>

<p>“Am I not logical when I say that pacifism must be
considered the first step to internationalism?” said Magnus.
There was in his voice the persuasive gentleness of
the born debater, who is confident of leading his opponent
to the conclusion he seeks. “If you wish nations to renounce
warring on each other by arms, isn’t it because
we are coming to the point of view that we are all human
beings on the same globe, artificially divided by national
lines? And if it is abhorrent to you that one nation
should murder another with gunpowder, isn’t it just as
wrong to seek by commercial warfare to impoverish and
reduce an inferior to a state of commercial slavery,
a portion of the same human race?”</p>

<p>I sat up, listening with strong attention. Thoughts
which had struggled for clarification in my own deliberate
mind started up. Once or twice I had come near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
breaking in with a question, so close to my own problems
had the debate come. Here were two men discussing
theories that might apply in a thousand years, when the
immediate problem was this present thing: what should
a nation&mdash;my nation&mdash;do in this world crisis, for its
greater good?</p>

<p>“Well, now, Magnus&mdash;there’s logic in what you say,
and I’m the more ready to admit it in that I haven’t the
slightest patience with what I used to believe.”</p>

<p>“What’s changed you?”</p>

<p>“France. Keeping my eyes open and seeing things as
they are in this world, and not as I want them to be.
Your internationalism is a political millennium, which will
come just about as soon as the other millennium. I used
to think that we were all pretty much alike, English,
American, German, and French. I’ve found out we’re
not. We’re not pursuing the same ideas. The English
world has settled down to an easy-going existence, each
man sufficient unto himself, occupied in his own private
affairs, getting farther and farther away from his
national ideal, looking on government as a convenient
policeman, a central telephone, and all that. And then,
there’s Germany&mdash;and the explanation of Germany is
national solidarity&mdash;every man fitting into the national
scheme, and every man working for the national aggrandizement.
‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Deutschland uber alles!</i>’ We used to laugh
at that. I don’t. It impresses me now. And it terrifies
me.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to live under such a system?”</p>

<p>“I’ll come back to that. No, I don’t want to be subjected
to that. That’s why I’m done with pacifism. Because
the world’s up against not simply German armies
but the German idea. And we may as well admit that
it is the German idea that’s got to be destroyed or
adopted: no two ways.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>“What does the man in the fields, or the man in the
street, care about all that?” said Magnus softly.</p>

<p>“If the French peasant and the French workman can
understand that, I guess we can,” said Brinsmade. “I
said France has changed me over to a belief in a strong
national feeling. It has. I don’t want German militarism,
but I want the sort of military education you see
in the French army,&mdash;preparation, with absolute democracy.”</p>

<p>“Compulsory service?”</p>

<p>“Of course. And I want it because I want my sons
to be educated into democracy, and I know no better way
than sending them out for a year or two to rough it with
the fellow who comes up out of the mines and fields, out
of the city slums and the wharves. I want them to eat
together, tramp together, sleep together, to learn how
to talk to each other. I want them to respect a man,
wherever found, and I want them to make themselves
respected as men. Moreover, I want them to have a
vision of what America is and can be. Why? Because
the wealth I leave them is going to make them leaders
and instead of artificial leadership I want intelligent
leadership.”</p>

<p>“You’ll never get compulsory training in America,”
said Magnus shortly. “That’s one thing I’m not worrying
about.”</p>

<p>“If we need it for nothing else, we need it to digest our
foreign classes,” said Brinsmade, warming up; “German,
Italian, Russian, Greek, Swedish; we need it for self-education,
to form our own race,&mdash;a clear-cut, united
American type. But of course,” he said, stopping suddenly,
“that doesn’t enter into your philosophy.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Magnus directly. “To me the greatness of
America is that it is not American. It has the whole
world in it and, as long as these world elements remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
distinctly defined in their inherited traditions, just so
long America remains the natural Parliament of Man.”</p>

<p>“The little Sassenach,” said a voice out of the night.
“Damned if I don’t hope a submarine gets us.”</p>

<p>Brinsmade laughed.</p>

<p>“Thanks, friend,” he said. “I feel almost that way,
myself.”</p>

<p>“Whether you like it or not, it is so to-day,” said Magnus,
“and the reason that internationalism will come as
an American doctrine is just that. We are international,
and not in a hundred years can we be anything else.
This to you may seem abhorrent, but to me it is the
greatest destiny that could come to us. You would wipe
out our links to other nations. I say, keep them; do
nothing to weaken them, and make them great bonds of
political thought, that America may lead the world.”</p>

<p>“What gets me&mdash;and by George, it does get me&mdash;”
Brinsmade blurted out, “is your assumption to speak for
my country. Good heavens; my family fought in
three wars, and you have been here twenty years and tell
me what America is, and&mdash;damn it&mdash;the worst is, I
believe you do know!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Brinsmade, I do,” said Magnus quietly.
“What do you know of the great East Side of New York?
What do you know of how multitudes think and act,&mdash;the
great labor organizations, the I. W. W? What do
you know of what you call the foreign press? Do you
know that there are over four hundred newspapers published
in a foreign tongue&mdash;German, French, Italian,
Swedish, Jewish and Hungarian&mdash;and that they represent
a circulation of millions? The foreign element that
was born abroad, or whose parents were born abroad,
represents twenty millions; you represent a dwindling
minority. You represent&mdash;we are talking frankly&mdash;an
insular element, and the strange thing is that you still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
persist in seeing America in that spirit of nationalism
which existed in Revolutionary days. America has
passed beyond such limitations, and you don’t realize it.”</p>

<p>“And this from a man who came to my country twenty-five
years ago!”</p>

<p>“But who has, perhaps, a greater vision of your country’s
mission in world affairs than you have,” retorted
Magnus.</p>

<p>“You are probably right,” said Brinsmade. “You
place crudely things that are coming into my mind and
the minds of others like me. Probably we are not awake.
Have we, the old American strain, lost our inheritance?”
He added, as if to himself, “And if so, is it our fault?”</p>

<p>Up the deck a spear of light shot across the night from
an open door. A group of young men, emerging from the
card room for a breath of air, came shuffling down the
deck, singing as they came.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I was drunk last night, dear mother;<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>“Hello there&mdash;Littledale!”</p>

<p>I cursed them mentally and returned an uninviting
grunt.</p>

<p>“Hello.”</p>

<p>“Counting the submarines?”</p>

<p>Four figures loomed at the foot of my chair.</p>

<p>“Some games running up there! Four tables. Better
take a hand.”</p>

<p>Farther up the line of chairs, a child, awakened by their
coming, began to cry.</p>

<p>“Not to-night. And say, if you want to make a night
of it, you fellows, tramp the upper deck. People want
to sleep down here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Captain,” said a laughing voice; but another
said, “Shut up, Limpy. The women are round here.
Come on: clear out.”</p>

<p>The sound of their heavy tramp died out in the distance.
A woman behind me sat up, rearranged her pillow,
and settled back. The child whimpered sleepily
and then grew quiet. In the distance some one began to
snore. The ship had begun a slight roll, as it fled, ghostlike
in a ghostly night, followed by noises of unseen
things; the hiss of hidden waves, a sudden leap of
spray, the creak of pulleys, a stifled whistle, and the
rumble of the invisible force that thrust it forward.</p>

<p>Magnus laughed.</p>

<p>“Your American inheritance; there it is!”</p>

<p>“Damned if I can listen to any more of that!”</p>

<p>I rose abruptly, kicking the rugs from my legs, and
went down the deck. I am, I suppose, too young not to
resent unwelcome arguments with a hot intolerance. Socialism
had meant to me little more than a name, which
I rejected on faith as something akin to anarchy. The
voice of the immigrant, speaking for my America, roused
in me a blind rebellion. The more so that, while he had
cut across every traditional instinct, I was at a loss in
the poverty of my mental experience to answer the coldly
stated propositions which, despite my will, convinced
me of some measure of their truth. Yet what had he
done but state in his own words thoughts which had been
in my own mind; yes, even those opinions which had
been surging uppermost,&mdash;that, in the coming test of a
changed democracy, my generation had let slip the leadership
that was its by inherited responsibility. I could
say this to myself, yet I could not brook it from another.
Why? Perhaps Mr. Brinsmade was right, and in the
conflicts of man to man there is no antagonism so deep-rooted,
so unreasoning, so obedient to inherited repulsions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
as that antagonism which in the field of ideas has
led men to persecute, to torture and to stamp out one
another with the fury of unreasoning beasts.</p>

<p>Of this reflection I was not then conscious. I felt
only the resentment of the man of action for the man
of thought. It was not the ideas, but the ideas in the
mouth of Peter Magnus which aroused my fury. I remember
standing a long time forward, sheltering myself
behind a bulging canvas which slapped against its
chains with windy explosions, trying to shake off my ill-humor,
until the cold cut of the spray which hissed over
the decks brought back some equanimity.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>IV</h3>

<p>I went inside. The sofas in the ladies’ saloon had
been turned into beds. Most of the women had already
put on their life preservers and were surrounded by impossible
mounds of baggage. An old man was methodically
deploying a pack of cards at a table. A woman,
with a child on her shoulder, was staring open-eyed at
the ceiling. Outside on the landing two returning sailors
and a nursemaid were whispering with sudden outbursts
of mirth,&mdash;Americans all, Yankee, Westerner, Scandinavian,
Latin and Asiatic.</p>

<p>I went upstairs and into the foul thickness of the
smoking room, where the shock of my entrance set the
layers of gray fumes to twisting and coiling about the
dim lamps. Groups had already formed at the corner
tables; Hungerford and the younger men, a solemn
audience about a chess match; another group near me&mdash;officers
of two torpedoed freighters&mdash;were swapping
yarns as they played.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>“Got ours out of Genoa, just after dawn.”</p>

<p>“Trouble getting away?”</p>

<p>“Shelled us right up to the last minute.”</p>

<p>A little woman, wife of the speaker, broke into a light
laugh.</p>

<p>“Kept on shellin’, too, when we got the boats clear.
Dan here, he says to me, ‘Sarah, you stand right up and
let ’em see there’s a woman in the boat.’ So I stood up,
and crack, they let go with a shot that jumped the bonnet
from my head. Polite, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell that at home: they’ll say you ex&mdash;aggerate!”
said a large, swarthy man, who was shuffling the cards.
“Civilized folks don’t do such things; that’s what they’ll
say!”</p>

<p>“Well, Sarah and I ain’t got no kick coming,” said the
skipper philosophically. “We got away with six trips
and landed the last cargo, too. Risky&mdash;but big money,
and I guess we’re on easy street for a while.”</p>

<p>“Say, if this war goes on another year, boy, we’ll have
all the money in the world.”</p>

<p>A short, stockily built young fellow, keen as a vulture,
derby pushed back, removed a fat cigar and nodded to
his neighbor, a type of world peddler, Armenian or Levantine,
who was chewing a toothpick in a drowsy interest.</p>

<p>“All the money in the world! And after? Say&mdash;I’ve
been over cleaning up <i>some</i> contracts, believe me;
but that’s nothin’ to what’s comin’&mdash;nothin’! Say&mdash;when
this little war’s over, any fellow who’s got somethin’
to sell is goin’ to cash in so fast a crooked gamblin’ wheel
won’t be in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, got a pretty good line, myself.”</p>

<p>“You have, eh? What?”</p>

<p>“Antiques.”</p>

<p>“Pretty soft bargains, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>The Levantine smiled contentedly. And the two, suddenly
attracted, moved into a corner, absorbed by their
own bright conceptions of the future.</p>

<p>“Hello, there, Big Dale. Ship ahoy!”</p>

<p>I sauntered over curiously to where Hungerford was
ensconced in the midst of congenial spirits.</p>

<p>“Have a hand?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Have a drink?”</p>

<p>“Not now.”</p>

<p>I had sat through just such all-night sessions in the
days when such feats were regarded as title to man’s
estate, but to-night the mood was foreign to my own.</p>

<p>“Shake hands with my old friend, ‘Gyp, the Blood,’
alias Frangipani,” said Hungerford, whose good humor
was proof against hunger, drowsiness, the cold gray dawn
and stale tobacco. “Mr. Frangipani was <i>not</i> a professor
of English at Columbia.”</p>

<p>“How be you, friend? Seen you on the deck,” said
a stocky, square fellow in ambulance uniform, who gave
me a drowsy squint from around a knobby nose and put
out a squatty hand which was minus a finger. “Not
drinkin’?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, no. The atmosphere is strong enough,” I
answered, wondering in what strange by-ways of civilization&mdash;tramp
steamer, traveler of the underworld,
or ranger of the Western prairies&mdash;the man had gone
his careless journey.</p>

<p>“Mr. Tooker, of Tookerville, Mississippi, sah. Mr.
Tooker is a close student of our great national game.”</p>

<p>“Very glad to know you, Mr. Littledale,” said a brisk
little fellow, sober, well-groomed, soft-voiced, alert and
smiling. “Heard a good deal about you.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Galligan, of Walla Walla. Mr. Galligan is returning
from his period of rest at the front to get a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
excitement in the Coeur d’Alene district,” said Hungerford,
who was in good spirits.</p>

<p>A powerful, big-framed youth, with bullet head, blue
eyes and thin lips, who had been making desperate attempts
at keeping his eyes open, yawned, and said
thickly:</p>

<p>“’Scuse me. Had a &mdash;&mdash; of a night in Bordeaux. Glad
to know you.”</p>

<p>“<i>And</i> Professor Ralph Waldo William Butler Swinburne
Southwick, of Harvard, and Beacon Street, and the
American Ambulance.”</p>

<p>Southwick, in his precipitation to shake hands, dropped
his glasses, which slid from his long, delving nose and
dangled back and forth on their short string, overturned
a pile of chips, and started to take up the discards, under
a storm of protests.</p>

<p>“Other members of the original Inter-Allied Poker Club
have succumbed to poison gas, auto-intoxication, and the
need of a recumbent position,” continued Hungerford,
with a wave of his hand toward two figures on the
couches, who had passed beyond the stage of introductions.
He paused and indicated a large, bulbous figure
under a sombrero, snoring peacefully in a sitting position
at his side. “The late Mr. Honus Scroff, of Tittle Valley,
Arizona. Mr. Scroff is especially delighted to meet you,”
he added, lifting the hat from the red, cropped hair
and freckled ears.</p>

<p>“Honus hasn’t been to bed since we started down,”
said Galligan, gathering in the cards.</p>

<p>“Quite right. Mr. Scroff’s like an eight-day clock;
he only has to sleep every Saturday night from 12 to 8.”</p>

<p>“Play ball!” said Frangipani loudly, throwing in an
ante.</p>

<p>Scroff woke, blinked, and said thickly, “My deal?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, old top!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>And he went off to sleep again.</p>

<p>“I’m in,” said the professor colloquially. “Shove
around the pasteboards.”</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">began Frangipani, in a long, doglike wail, which drew
curses from the four corners of the room. The cards
were dealt and the bets began.</p>

<p>I stood watching them quite a while, amused at their
patter. They were real, as I had learned to value men
in the rough-and-tumble of life. It was Young America
relaxing,&mdash;the need of a young nation to return to its
play, to blow off steam after months of driven dynamic
energy. Quite barbaric at bottom, perhaps,&mdash;but so
understandable, to me! I liked the democracy of the
group and its unconscious camaraderie. Yet, I could not
help thinking how unrelated we were to one another,&mdash;to
the present or to the future. And, as I stood there
studying them&mdash;in my mind the menace that Magnus
had voiced&mdash;I wondered how long we could stem the
moving forces below that had the solidarity and the
energy of determined rebels.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>To-night, as I recall this first conversation with Magnus,
my irritation dies away. I am not sure but what he
has but stated in his own antagonistic way things which
have been growing over me.</p>

<p>Democracy was a revolt against the leadership of a
class when that leadership had grown weak and was no
longer natural and genuine. But, if democracy cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
produce its own real leadership&mdash;if it can do no more
than set in motion a mob&mdash;the leadership of that mob
will be the leadership that surges out of the accidents
of a stampede.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>V</h3>

<p>Four bells rang from the forecastle when I returned
to my chair on the lower deck. Brinsmade and Magnus
were breathing heavily. I enclosed my legs in the rug,
burrowed my nose in my great coat, and sought sleep.
Disturbed by the bustle of my arrival, the young woman
at my side stirred in her sleep and moaned. The dream
passed into a nightmare for, struggling suddenly against
some grim horror of unreality, she burst into a cry:</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ma mère! Ma mère,&mdash;oh non, pas ça!</i>”</p>

<p>The scream awoke a score of passengers. Out of the
darkness voices cried excitedly:</p>

<p>“What’s happened?”</p>

<p>“Submarine?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!”</p>

<p>People began to rise and grope towards the cabins. I
heard Brinsmade and Magnus struggling to their feet.
Another moment, and a panic would have swept over us.
I called out cheerily:</p>

<p>“Nothing wrong! Somebody’s got a bad dream;
nothing else!”</p>

<p>Then I leaned over and caught the arm of the dreamer.
She groaned, shivered, and sat up.</p>

<p>“A nightmare, Mademoiselle,” I said, loud enough to
be heard down the deck. “All right now. Nothing
wrong.”</p>

<p>She was sitting bolt upright, straining against the
horror of the passing phantom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>“Pardon, Mademoiselle, for having taken your arm&mdash;it
seemed best&mdash;you were evidently&mdash;” I stopped
lamely, a prey to the diffidence I had felt in her presence
from the first approach.</p>

<p>She had not moved.</p>

<p>“I hope I did not offend you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she said suddenly. “It was a dream&mdash;a
terrible dream!”</p>

<p>Her voice was not yet under control. I waited, but
having said this, she drew back into her silence. Presently,
I heard her settling back into her chair. Quiet had
returned to the deck. I sat there, keenly awake. The
memory of her cry haunted me and, though the utter
blackness prevented my seeing her, I had the feeling that
she, too, was tremulously, nervously awake at my side.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Often have I wondered what makes us so blind to our
own selves, and sometimes I think it is our insistence in
seeing our lives as a logical development. We seek in
all phases of life a working formula (formulas which are
not knowledge but the substitute for knowledge) and we
early adopt a formula about our own selves. We never
see ourselves whole because, perhaps, we never complete
our own image.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I know that I, too, am a slave to my own formula. I
say to myself that I am an average man,&mdash;that, given
a problem of action, I will do under given circumstances
just what the average man will do; that, if I am better
or worse, it is all in the quality of opportunity. I am influenced
largely by the judgment my neighbors would
pass on me&mdash;by a desire to maintain my own self-respect,
or to return to it&mdash;and yet I am conscious of
but a distant and imperfect acquaintance with this self
which is my court of last judgment. And, when I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
said all this, I am conscious that I have explained nothing,&mdash;that
there is always at the bottom of myself some unpremeditated,
rebellious impulse that in the moments
of most determined progress towards a given point suddenly
sends me blindly in another direction. What is that
invisible, intangible sense? I obey by instinct something
that I do not comprehend. I follow myself through
changing phases and wonder at the instinct that brings
me back to the level of common sense&mdash;as a ship in a
storm struggles to right itself. I am here as I am to-day
by some agency that mystifies me,&mdash;invisible forces from
without, or some instinct from within. Yet as I look
back I see no logical relation in the process.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>That night, half-awake, half-adream, four figures
passed before me, conjured up from the cauldron of my
imagination, as the mystic sequence which greeted Macbeth.</p>

<p>The First: A boy, with the eyes of faith, believing in
the good of the world, a scrubby, tousled little urchin,
in and out of mischief, just beginning to penetrate beyond
the borders of fairyland, passionately curious; a
rich little mind exploring vast continents of treasured
knowledge; a youngster who had already dared climb the
magic walls of childhood and hesitated before the jump
into the strange real world. What was I then? All of
creation was within my imagination; society was expressed
in three laws,&mdash;the rising bell, soap, and the
Sunday prohibitions. The first two I comprehended (in
my male’s instinct for order); the last I never did. What
had happened to the world that periodically, at the end
of each week, a sudden hush should fall in the household,
that romping must cease and playthings be hidden away,
and the body encased in starched shirts and shining black
suits, and the young romping spirits should be led in leash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
to hard benches and the pointing finger. Father and
mother were majestic, Olympian figures, never quite understood;
authority was absolute, and the world black
or white. My first love, a young lady of twenty years,
was an angel stepping down out of the parted heavens,
whose voice thrilled to the secret caverns of my heart.
She stopped but a week at our home and I have never
seen her since, yet in those short days I fell so desperately
in love with her&mdash;greatest and most radiant of fairy
princesses&mdash;that to this day I can feel my little heart
stop as over the bed-covers I saw her come to my bedside,
all fragrance and loveliness, to touch my eyelids
with her lips. And then, they told me that she was to be
married; that she had gone and I would see her no more.
I remembered the child quivering under his first touch
of sorrow, poignant and overwhelming. That first knowledge
of sorrow, the utter loneliness, the incomprehension
that such things could exist in the simplicity of the world!
There was no refuge but in dreams and for months I
lived for my dream,&mdash;for that moment when the candle
wick glowed and dropped into the darkness and the shimmering
stars came through the open window, and my
dreams would begin anew, as out of the peopled dark,
ogres and kings’ sons, Napoleons and presidents, Hercules
and Ulysses, fairy godmothers and elves, and&mdash;always&mdash;the
loveliest princess in the world came forth
to fetch me into the fantasy of the future.</p>

<p>Sometimes now, thinking on that future, I wonder,
should I have sons, if any of them will be as real to me as
that boy. I think not. In the man, the first-born and the
closest to his heart must ever be the boy that was. I see
now that it was that first imagined sorrow which led me
beyond the magic garden of childhood into the questioning
of youth. There were nights, moonlit nights and starry
nights, when I crept to my window and strove to pierce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the riddle of the strange things above; when I stood
and wondered and shivered, a little mind striving to penetrate
the sky, pitting itself against Infinity. And, as I
watched this young self there in the still of the covered
night, I wondered. Now, I seldom dream or question:
I have retreated behind my formulas. But what became
of all the brave little thoughts, the fancy, the rich curiosity
and the eagerness for first knowledge? Which is
the true, abiding self,&mdash;this, or the pebble fashioned by
the grinding, restless forces of Society?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Second Figure: A young man of twenty, outwardly
disciplined, walking, talking, dressing like ten thousand
other well-groomed, mechanical products of the educational
factories; inwardly, a turbulent appetite for life,
a mind which had stopped functioning, an imagination
buried, but with every impulse and curiosity vibrantly
awake. Never have I been surer of myself, and never
was I more worked upon by forces which I did not understand;
I, a high-strung young animal suddenly released
into the pastures of youth. Everything appealed
to me; every broad way and byway in the vast forest of
life sent me galloping down it in exploration. Each impulse,
good or evil, was genuine and irresistible. I adored
one woman as a saint, blushed and stumbled in her presence,
trembled at the contact of her fingers and, in the
full flush of this puppy-love, could feel my blood surge
at a brazen glance. I drank too much, gambled outrageously:
yet it was not from any desire for ugliness,
but from the sheer joy of wrestling with invisible outer
forces, in a strange belief that I, a privileged being,
could affront the gods of chance and bind them to my
way. I dissipated a month’s allowance in a day; fell into
deep periods of religious speculation; rebelled at dogma
and constituted authority; rejected all that was old and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
followed everything that was new. All this I did as hungrily
as I sat down at table, without knowing in the
slightest why I did it. Yet this is not quite true. Already,
I had begun to be conscious of a dual self, a self
that acted and a self that watched. Often, I went madly
towards an infatuation which would have meant the end
of all things, knowing all the time the fatality of it, powerless
to resist and saved only by some trick of circumstance.
The truth was that my blood ran too rapidly in
my veins, the delight in every sense was too imperious,
the joy of being alive too intoxicating.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Still, in this period when everything was fermenting,
fructifying, bubbling to the surface in me, my outlook
was of the simplest. Black was still black, and white,
white. Women were good or bad,&mdash;and both drew me
to them. I broke the laws of society, but I believed in
them, fully determined at some calmer, wiser period of
my life to maintain and defend them. So, when I was
most inconsistent, I had faith in inconsistency. I repented
with the same ardor with which I transgressed.</p>

<p>I walked down the avenue, and my imagination took
fire at the brilliant women in their speeding luxury.
What did I feel? The need of exerting the supremacy of
my youth over their shallow, sparkling little souls. I sat
in a great Opera House and, before that insistent, imperious
parade of society, dreamed of some future date
when I who was now lost in the crowd would impose myself.
Everything in me was force, faith, and desire, and
all these young impulses tugged at my soul for the opportunity
to express themselves. How confident, how
wise, how convinced I was, and&mdash;I knew nothing. For,
mentally, it was a period of arrested development, when
I mistook hunger for strength, vanity for power, longing
for capacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>We are all, I suppose, more or less cases of arrested
development. When a man ceases to inquire, to explore,
and to wonder, when he is convinced of his knowledge,
when he reaches the point where all his free and flexible
opinions have settled into hardened convictions, at that
moment his development is stopped, even as a little child
whose mind cannot move beyond the A. B. C.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>This was what I was in the days when all within me
was but an appetite for life. What shook my equanimity
and violently freed me of my self-complacency? The
first contact with evil, the knowledge and the mysterious
reaction.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Third Figure: A man approaching thirty, perhaps too
near to be seen distinctly, and yet in such violent contrast
that before its note of worldly knowledge boyhood
and youth fled from the contact. I saw a man whose
eyes had gone behind every scene, whose back had
turned, he believed, on every illusion, tolerant of every
frailty, amused at little hypocrisies and of those greater
shams which an arrogant society imposes on the outsider
and itself defies with impunity: steeped in this class
cynicism, without realizing that in the strong nourishing
forces of civilization this society is but the scum that
rises to the surface and that in the old <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pot-au-feu</i> below
are the vital nourishments of the race. I had come
eagerly into the brilliant cosmopolitan society of Europe
with enough money and proper credentials, and I had
come as how many young men of imagination and fire
before me, believing in pleasure as the goal of life,
pleasure, which I had seen in my ardent nature as in youth
one sees and believes in the painted beauties and the
paste jewels behind footlights. I recoiled, I grew accustomed
to what I at first resented. I shrugged my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
shoulders, and, in the end, I did as those I lived with did.
In the unconscious progression is the whole story. I
became a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">flâneur</i> of society. I knew the comedies and
tragedies of a ballroom as an old collector on the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">quais</i>
recognizes and smiles over the titles whose stories he
knows. I lived a life of crowded inconsequences. The
days and nights were consumed in doing&mdash;what to-day
is a blank of years. But how my world had narrowed!
The limitless horizons and starry spaces of childhood,
even the mysterious depths of youth, had contracted
into confines so narrow that my daily run of life
was more provincial than that of a buried village.
Why did I not go on in the paths of worldly wisdom, with
a cynical weighing of actual values? Why did I not
continue steadfast, as my logic showed me? The truth
lay, perhaps, in the heart of a child that we men can
never quite kill. The first impulse is the abiding impulse;
if you would know the man, know the child.</p>

<p>It was in vain I told myself that only the living was
vital, and that in a world of sceptics and pagans only the
fools cling to compunctions. I repeated to myself that
the sum of all moralities is in the instinct of the man to believe
what he wants to believe. It brought me no calm. I
did wrong, saying to myself that it was not wrong, and yet
all the time I knew in my restlessness that it was wrong.
Madame de Tinquerville instilled into my veins this mental
corruption and yet, at the end, when I believed that
I had accepted everything, a nausea seized me and I flung
this self violently aside. Then the mobilization, and a
new self.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Fourth Figure: I, myself,&mdash;if not the self of to-morrow,
the self of to-day: an exile. For I had been that
all these long embittered months,&mdash;an exile from all that
life had been to me, a man grown suddenly taciturn, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
smoked his pipe, lying in a mud hole behind a flap, and
gazed up at the thin blue avenue of the trenches overhead;
smoked, obeyed, questioned not, and was content to
have found a meaning. Atavism, perhaps, the content to be
just man again, following man’s instinct to survive among
the fittest. I knew life as though I had been born to it
again. Three times a day I thrilled with the delight of
eating; I knew the ecstasy of sleep after fatigue; I wept
at the loss of a comrade, and my whole heart rejoiced
when in the exhaustion after battle with my closing
vision I felt the rough hands of a convict drawing his
coat over me with the tenderness of a woman. The world
had no perplexities for me. The mask was discarded.
I felt myself brute, Crusader, sinner, pagan and saint,
and each mood was genuine. I saw men in the frenzy
of combat swept into moments of unbelievable ferocity.
I myself knew moments when there was nothing human
in me, when courage was but the panic for existence.
And out of the abnormal slaying self I would grope back
into the man that reasoned over his actions and shivered
at the animal that had run wild. I knew the pagan hour
that comes so easily to those who have felt the breath of
passing destruction continuously at their side. In the
whirlpool and the whipping trenches I have seen my comrade
at arms struck and strewn into unrecognizable
matter and have felt but one instinctive thought:</p>

<p>“I live&mdash;I still live!”</p>

<p>Yet, later, in a more reasoning mood, deliberately and
calmly, I have gone back as others went, into the certainty
of destruction, to rescue a wounded stranger. I
have returned with the living, singing, greedy of life,&mdash;a
bed of hay paradise and a can of <i>Pinard</i> the ecstasy of
forgetfulness. I have rebelled, hesitated, been caught
with the cold nausea of fear, thrilled at a word from a
peasant boy kneeling and crossing himself, and awakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
to the call of leadership which was mine by <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noblesse
oblige</i>, become suddenly and disdainfully impersonal
when responsibility had fallen to me and I could do no
less than the least. Other moments there were, when I
walked, a lone sentry in the night, among the sleeping
and the dead, when a feeling of reverence and awe possessed
my soul at the slow revolving stars, and I wondered
at the futility of victors and vanquished under the things
that change not. I knew moments of intense intellectual
clarity when my mind seemed to take wing and
lift me above the soiled reality of conflict into a mystic
sense of my own loneliness in the scheme of things. At
such moments, when only the questioning remained, I
had a disdain of danger and of the death which went unseen
and whining in the night,&mdash;a disdain that was absolute.
Yet in the morning, cramped in a dugout, I heard
above me the great shells shatter and felt the cold sweat
rise in my back. After this can the other life be real?
I wonder. Or will all this pass into a dim incredible
memory?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>And so, through the long night, there on the hidden
deck among those who waited and feared, next to the
woman at my side, awake, too, with her memories, I saw
my strange selves pass and wondered. Which was the
nearest kin to the David of that hour? What new figure
would come out of the future that was as impenetrable
as the dark that wrapped me about?</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>VI</h3>

<p>I think I must have gone off into a half-sleep, for all
at once my eyes opened to gray and wavering shapes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
The skeleton outline of the creaking ship grew out of
the fluid dawn, figures of sleeping passengers rose out of
the obscurity and across the rail glimmered the white
curl of the clearing sea. My first instinctive impulse
was to the woman at my side.</p>

<p>The veil had been thrown back; the long lashes lay on
the brown cheek across which clung a spray of dark
hair. The front of the rough Breton hood half concealed
the clear rise of the forehead and soaring eyebrows, the
fine delicacy of the high-bridged nose, the full and sensitive
lips. One hand lay at her throat, a rosary entwined
in her fingers and the silver flash of a crucifix. I thought
then that I had never looked upon anything so gentle, so
fragile, so pure. She was so far removed from the things
of this heavy world that in her semi-recumbent position,
I thought of some sculptured saint, asleep in an olden
monastery.</p>

<p>Her eyes opened, rested in mine a full moment, read
my thoughts, and dropped away. Instantly, she drew
her veil, sat up, and averted her head. Within me
everything grew troubled and confused. I rose hastily
and went down the deck.</p>

<p>I can remember to this day the sudden timidity that
overcame me always in her presence, the eagerness to
speak to her, and the hesitancy whenever I found an
excuse. In her, too, I see now, two impulses fought, for
at times, in her instinct to repel me, she was brusque
almost to the point of rudeness and her manner so determinedly
antagonistic that I grew diffident as a boy.
What had become of the man of the world? I, who
prided myself on my knowledge of women, was as awkward
in her presence, as helpless and at loss as the veriest
schoolboy. I can remember that I had but one thought
on awakening,&mdash;to do her some service. Yet when I
had returned from below-decks with a thermos bottle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
hot coffee I was utterly nonplussed for some pretext to
approach her.</p>

<p>I came hesitantly down the strewn deck. The sky was
graying rapidly now, as the dawn crept in chill and
sickly. Astern, the low-huddled funnels of our escort,&mdash;guardian
of our night. Brinsmade and Magnus had
wakened and gone below. The lady with the child was
sitting up, rearranging her veil. A sudden inspiration
came to me. I stopped and made my offer.</p>

<p>“A drop of hot coffee, Madame?”</p>

<p>She took it, smiling and grateful, refusing a second
cup. I breathed more freely, for I felt I had removed
all personal emphasis. I passed on.</p>

<p>“Won’t you also, Mademoiselle, have a bit of coffee?
It’s a long way to breakfast.”</p>

<p>Yet, as I said this, I had a sudden weak feeling of
intruding, and I looked away from her for fear she would
read beneath the studied impersonality of my tone. Behind
the veil, I felt a moment of hesitation.</p>

<p>“If you will hold the bottle, I will get some clean
glasses.”</p>

<p>When I returned, I brought a box of crackers, taking
the precaution to offer them along the way. This action
evidently disarmed her prejudices, for she had drawn her
veil when I came to her chair. I poured a full glass.</p>

<p>“But you, Monsieur?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve had my cup, below. Take it&mdash;you need it.
I’m afraid you had a bad night.”</p>

<p>She took the glass but made no answer. When I referred
to the night, her gray-eyed glance rose to my face,
rested a furtive moment in thoughtful inquiry, and retreated;
but the moment was not one of embarrassment
or hesitation, but rather of a settled attitude of aloofness.</p>

<p>“There is just a little more.”</p>

<p>“Some one else, then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>I poured out what remained and handed it to her,
pressing her acceptance.</p>

<p>“Thank you&mdash;no more.”</p>

<p>She drew on her glove, lowered her veil, and sank
back once more.</p>

<p>Feeling a certain irritation that in this first clash of
authority she should have resisted, I sat down.</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning I’ll be better provided.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow? We spend another night on deck?” she
said, in surprise.</p>

<p>“That’s orders. But you don’t obey orders,” I said,
glancing at the deck. “Orders are to bring your life
belt, and you’ve not done it.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I didn’t think of it.”</p>

<p>“You are not afraid?”</p>

<p>“Afraid? Of that?” she said slowly. She shook her
head and I wondered at the look behind her veil.</p>

<p>The tone in which it was said, coupled with the memory
of that meeting on the upper deck, thrilled me. I
sought to make her talk, to establish a natural acquaintance,
through no forward curiosity but out of a genuine
sympathy. Yet I was so keenly aware of the bar which
her traditions interposed that I waited a long moment
before I had courage to say:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, I hope you will forgive my presumption
of last night.”</p>

<p>“Presumption?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was that. I hope you did not misunderstand
my action.”</p>

<p>She turned.</p>

<p>“I did not misunderstand that, no,” she said reluctantly,
for I was forcing her into a conversation against
her will, “and yet, why should you have done it?”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” I said, surprised at the quickening
of my pulses, “I have done what little I could to help,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
because I love your people. I have lived among sorrow
and terror. Am I not allowed to understand, and try
to help, just&mdash;because it is one of my own kind?”</p>

<p>She did not reply at once. I felt that her eyes were
on me.</p>

<p>“You Americans have kind hearts, Monsieur, and I
thank you again.”</p>

<p>To this day I can remember the thrill of pleasure that
came to me with the first softening of her voice, that
first note which told me that in her eyes I was no longer
just one of the passing crowd.</p>

<p>“I know how a young girl is brought up in France,”
I began <span class="locked">hurriedly&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We are no young girls now, Monsieur. There are
only women in France.”</p>

<p>The voice was back into the measured, impersonal
tone.</p>

<p>I looked at her, amazed, started to speak and
stopped. I understood that I should gain nothing by
forcing a conversation, and though every instinct urged
me to remain near her, I rose to withdraw.</p>

<p>“May I present myself, Mademoiselle, since we are to
be companions for a while? I am Mr. David Littledale.”</p>

<p>She bowed in acknowledgment but made no answer,
and I went down the deck with a stirring uneasiness at
the awkwardness which it seemed to me I had displayed
in every word and action. Later in the day I found a
card on her chair. The name was like herself, a veil
thrown up against my curiosity.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Renée Duvernoy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>VII</h3>

<p>An ocean steamer is a great university of the world.
Infinity of sea and sky bring an incredulity of the defined
land, where strange human beings move under precise
conventions to the tyranny of what is or is not done.
For me the comprehensible world was but this speck of
wood, swinging between water and sky. The salt democracy
of the sea and the common sense of danger run
quickened our senses and let down the barriers of our
Anglo-Saxon restraint.</p>

<p>Yet of all those who crowded the decks the one woman
who interested me most defied all my attempts at friendship.
Beyond the unconventionality of our first meetings
on the dock and by the upper rail I had been unable to
progress. Indeed, all her attitude indicated a studied
resolve to retreat from the memory of that accidental
intimacy. Her greeting each morning was gracious. She
allowed me to arrange her pillows and wrap her solicitously
in her steamer rugs.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I thank you; you are very kind.”</p>

<p>She said it gravely, with a slight acknowledgment of
her head, but her tone remained impersonal and she conveyed
to me, without possibility of misunderstanding,
that her privacy was to be respected, and it was not until
I had gone off for a tramp of the decks or had turned
into the constant discussion which ran on between Magnus
and Brinsmade that she drew her veil and picked up
her book. The book was but a pretext. For hours she
held it before her without the turning of a page.</p>

<p>At times, I pretended to go off into long siestas, studying
her furtively in short examinations. For despite every
precaution, if my glance remained on her too long, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
became aware of it and, if I persisted, she retired behind
her veil.</p>

<p>This very reserve stirred my curiosity. My imagination
was drawn to the mystery I divined of some inner
conflict beneath the precise formality of her outer manner.
Her slightest action became to me the important record
of my day. I studied her and wondered. There were
hollows in her cheek that should not have gone with her
years. Often in the warm, impulsive lips I detected the
set droop of long fatigue, while about the eyes, which
remained long moments lost in the healing distance, I
felt the still quivering lines of remembered pain. She
seemed so out of place that, with the memory of my own
exile, I felt intuitively the struggle of a soul brutally torn
from its protecting affections and forced by the tragic
hazards of war to struggle for readjustment and the right
to go on living. I felt this and yet I could not intrude.
About her, in everything she did, in every word she
uttered, was an authority I could not but respect.</p>

<p>Her day was measured in an unvarying routine. She
came from breakfast, walked alone for an hour, took
to her chair and read, with long periods of abstracted
contemplation, until a glance at her watch apprised her
of the time for another turn of the deck.</p>

<p>When she walked, it was without movement of the hips
or shoulders, her elbows to her sides, with a curious erect
and measured grace, as our grandmothers used to walk,&mdash;when
our grandmothers were straight and slender. Her
step was light and leisurely, without purpose. She paused
often, leaning against the rail, to gaze into the western
distances, before resuming her pensive strolling. In the
afternoon, particularly at the stealing in of the dusk, I
saw her turn to her prayer-book. Then she became so
absorbed that she forgot my presence completely, lifted
into regions where I could not follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>The method, the dryness, the precision of this routine
would have convinced me were it not for a memory,&mdash;the
cry of the woman in her loneliness on the upper deck.
With that memory in mind, I felt from the first the
struggle and the conflict,&mdash;two natures contending
within her; or rather that, with some determined resolve
before her, as a novice about to renounce the world, she
was striving to impose upon herself a discipline, mental
and moral, which was not in the ardent and impulsive
rebellion of her temperament.</p>

<p>The short word of greeting, the punctilious farewell at
night, in a manner grave, restrained, and without a smile,
were all so carefully adjusted to the most obvious civilities
that I despaired of ever penetrating her reserve. Yet
when the opportunity came it came as naturally as it was
unexpected.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Among the few children was a boy of five or six who
enjoyed great popularity among the passengers. The
child, attracted to Mademoiselle Duvernoy by childhood’s
instinct to those who have borne pain, passed and repassed
a dozen times a day before her chair, seeking by every
artifice to catch her eye.</p>

<p>The fourth morning out, when we were stretched
languidly in our steamer chairs, Master Jack, enveloped
in leggings, sweater and muffler, wabbled down like a
rolling ball of cotton and, after the usual preliminary
skirmishes, rallying his courage, stopped directly between
our chairs and said timidly:</p>

<p>“How do?”</p>

<p>The piping voice startled her from her mechanical contemplation.
She dropped her book and her body seemed
to shrink back.</p>

<p>“I talk to you a little while&mdash;yes?”</p>

<p>The smile of the young suppliant would have won over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
a jury, yet to my surprise she did not unbend and the
greeting was forced and perfunctory.</p>

<p>“Good-morning.”</p>

<p>Determined, the youngster sidled up and stood gazing
in adoration.</p>

<p>“Why you wear that ugly veil all the time?”</p>

<p>As he asked the question, the childish fingers fastened
and turned about her wrist, while the young eyes grew
big with sympathy. I saw her arm draw hastily back
from the contact. Then, after a moment, as though
obeying a superior determination, it came forward slowly
and reluctantly.</p>

<p>“The veil is not ugly.”</p>

<p>The tone, the action, the undefined look with which
she stared at him, impressed the child. A serious expression
came over his face,&mdash;a look of trying to understand
something beyond his ken.</p>

<p>“Is it because you are so very sad?” he said softly.</p>

<p>I felt her panic before the child’s innocent directness
and that in her helplessness she turned to me.</p>

<p>“Come here, Jack the Giant Killer,” I said, catching
him up and swinging him through the air to plant him
firmly on my lap. “How old are you? Where are you
going? What makes the steam white, the water wet,
and why does the wind sing? Do you know all that?”</p>

<p>“Why is the water wet?” said the youngster.</p>

<p>“You don’t know? Goodness&mdash;neither do I!”</p>

<p>The child, with his eyes still on Mademoiselle Duvernoy,
extended a pudgy forefinger.</p>

<p>“Is she your sister?”</p>

<p>“No, young man: and Mademoiselle Duvernoy is not
my daughter, nor my cousin, aunt or wife,” I said hastily,
with a fear of coming questions. “And if you will promise,
solemnly promise, not to ask another question, I’ll tell
you the story of ‘Puss-in-Boots’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>“I know ‘Puss-in-Boots’!”</p>

<p>“Well, ‘Cinderella and the Glass Slipper’.”</p>

<p>“I know ‘Cinderella’.”</p>

<p>“Well, what don’t you know?”</p>

<p>“I like the story of the Bears,” said the youngster decidedly.</p>

<p>“Humph! Now, that is funny,” I said, to gain time,
for my memory was not of the clearest. To save the situation,
I decided to improvise. “That is funny, because,&mdash;do
you know, that reminds me of myself and my
brothers. What do you think they called us? ‘Big
Dale, Little Dale, Weeny Dale, and No Dale at All’!”</p>

<p>“You look like a bear,” said the youngster gravely.</p>

<p>“So they say. Well, once upon a time there was a
little girl,&mdash;a very little girl, with the most wonderful
golden hair in the world. She was called&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Snow-White!”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Golden-Locks. Well, one day, Golden-Locks
went out walking in the woods, and she saw the
most wonderful butterfly in the world, with diamonds
glittering on its wings. She went on and on, following
the diamond butterfly, until all at once she came to a
little river that was flowing milk; but that wasn’t the
strangest thing&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No?” said Master Jack, with round eyes.</p>

<p>“No. On the opposite side was a house,&mdash;all made
of gingerbread; but that wasn’t the strangest thing.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“No. She went inside, and there, on the table, were
five white plates.”</p>

<p>But here Master Jack sat up in protest.</p>

<p>“How could there be five plates, when there is only
three Bears?”</p>

<p>“Three? Who said there were only three Bears?
There were five Bears in the story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>“Three!”</p>

<p>“Five. The story of the Five Bears. Don’t I know?”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t there only three Bears?” said Master Jack,
who had caught the now amused glance of Mademoiselle
Duvernoy.</p>

<p>“Three&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>“There&mdash;you see!” exclaimed the youngster. “And&mdash;and
wasn’t she called Snow-White?”</p>

<p>“She was.”</p>

<p>“There!”</p>

<p>“Then they’re not the same Bears,” said I, in pretended
wrath. “My Bears are American Bears. There
was Father Growler and Mother Gruff&mdash;that makes
two&mdash;and Grumble Bear and Guzzle Bear&mdash;and that
makes four&mdash;and then there was Tinkle Bear&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That makes five!”</p>

<p>“I resign,” I said, with tremendous dignity. “Tell it
your own way.”</p>

<p>But instead of protests and capitulation, the critic
stood to his colors.</p>

<p>“You don’t tell it at all the right way,” said the prejudiced
public in the person of Master Jack. “You put in
things that don’t belong. You tell it?” he said, suddenly
turning to Mademoiselle Duvernoy, who had been smiling
at my perplexity.</p>

<p>“Oh, but Mr. Littledale tells it very well.”</p>

<p>“You tell it yourself, and I’ll correct you,” I said,
laughing.</p>

<p>The issue was settled by Master Jack who, with a sudden
wriggle, transferred himself to the other chair. I
rose to reclaim the truant, who had snuggled up to her
shoulder, but she shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, no, he can stay.”</p>

<p>Her arms closed about the fluffy rascal, and she began.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Snow-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>White,
who lived with her father, a wood-chopper, in the
woods&mdash;”</p>

<p>The youngster nodded, satisfied, glancing at me from
time to time with malicious triumph as the narration
ran along classic lines. Her voice was low, warmed with
tenderness, and with the serio-comic pantomime of the
story there came into her face a new light, all gentleness.
I bent forward, listening to the melody of the voice
without attention to the narrative, my eyes fixed on the
mobile, fugitive expressions of her face. Why had she
resisted the child at first,&mdash;shrinking from his touch?
And, why this sudden melting?</p>

<p>“And the enchanted Prince came out and married
Snow-White, and they lived happily, ever and ever
after!”</p>

<p>But only half of the audience heard her. Master Jack
was fast asleep.</p>

<p>“I thought I made up a very good story,” I said hurriedly,
fearing the opportunity would pass.</p>

<p>“You see, fairy stories are better each time they are
told over&mdash;and that’s why they must always be kept
the same.”</p>

<p>We lowered our voices.</p>

<p>“I thought for a moment you&mdash;” I caught myself.
“I beg your pardon; I was going to ask you a personal
question, and I know you don’t like that.”</p>

<p>“You thought I disliked children, didn’t you?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Why, yes&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It was not that. Memories&mdash;” She checked herself,
frowning.</p>

<p>“Of course. I understand,” I said hurriedly, as I saw
the old expression of sadness cloud her face. “I am
sorry. Don’t you want me to take the youngster? He
is rather heavy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no, please.”</p>

<p>I felt opportunity slipping from me.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Duvernoy, it must seem strange to you,
a French girl, brought up as you were, to realize this
freedom of the sea?”</p>

<p>She turned to me in astonishment.</p>

<p>“What do you know about the way I have been brought
up, Monsieur?” The tone was a return to the old formality.
Yet her eyes, in the brief second they met mine,
had a certain fugitive alarm.</p>

<p>“I have lived in France. I know the ways of your
people, and I have been privileged to know many of your
old families. I am certain we have acquaintances in common,
of the Faubourg St. Germain; and I know how
rigidly the daughters are brought up.”</p>

<p>She frowned and shook her head decisively.</p>

<p>“You are quite mistaken about me. I have come to
America to earn my own living.”</p>

<p>The tone in which she said it was imperative, set
and admitting no debate.</p>

<p>“If you are a Frenchwoman, coming to my country, in
whatever way, I hope I may be honored by your friendship.”</p>

<p>“But, Monsieur,” she retorted, in a gentler tone, “I
don’t see how you and I can touch at any point; our ways
are entirely different; and my traditions do not permit
me to make chance acquaintanceships. Pardon me for
saying this frankly to you, but it is a question of
pride.”</p>

<p>I felt the door had been firmly closed in my face. Why
such a rebuff, when every instinct in me had been but of
kindness? I was hurt, and my manner showed it. I
turned stiffly, and, sinking back in my chair, returned to
my book. Master Jack woke up and departed in search
of a tray of cookies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Littledale,&mdash;please?”</p>

<p>I looked up so hastily that the book slipped from my
hands and tumbled to the deck.</p>

<p>“I did not mean anything to offend you. You won’t
be offended, will you?”</p>

<p>“Why, just for a moment, I wasn’t quite sure&mdash;”
Such a clear feeling of joy rose in me, after the blank
discouragement of a moment before, that I cried out:</p>

<p>“Good heavens, no; of course, I won’t!”</p>

<p>She looked at me a little shyly and then away, hesitating,
and I feared I had frightened her away again with
my tactless impulsiveness. However, after a moment, she
turned to me.</p>

<p>“You were in the Legion, Monsieur?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Long?”</p>

<p>“I went in with the mobilization.”</p>

<p>“May I ask why you, an American, did that?”</p>

<p>“I could not help myself. It was so much bigger than
anything else that had come into my life.”</p>

<p>She thought this over a moment and then nodded as
though pleased.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes&mdash;the mobilization. It made us very proud
of our old French race.”</p>

<p>“It made me proud of my fellow beings!”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;an American&mdash;felt that?”</p>

<p>“Particularly because I was an American,” I found
myself saying, with great warmth. “Oh, I do not sentimentalize
war. I have lived it.”</p>

<p>“You do not see it as only brutalizing, as that book
‘Gaspard,’ of which we are so much ashamed?”</p>

<p>“No, if that were the only side, France would not be
living to-day.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Monsieur,” she said, in sudden friendliness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>“The truth is in neither point of view. We cannot say
that war ennobles or brutalizes mankind. I have thought
about this much, and this is what I think: the man who
is fundamentally a brute is made more brutal; the man
who has in him a spark of nobility, even unsuspected,
is lifted up. What war does is to search our souls and
discover the ultimate truth. You see, in times of peace,
we all more or less wear a mask for our neighbors. Well,
when you’ve once gone into the trenches, that all disappears:
you find out what you believe. When all may
be over at any moment, you do what you want to do.
And the strange thing is that each respects the other’s
point of view.”</p>

<p>“I think there is one thing you have left out,” she said,
after a moment’s thought.</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“The question of leadership. When he who leads is
simple and high of heart, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i> always responds.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true, absolutely true.”</p>

<p>“War is a time when the leader is everything, isn’t it?”
She thought a moment, and added, with a little
weariness in her voice: “That is why I think, no matter
what the hideous suffering that comes, it does set us right
and turn us from false leaders.”</p>

<p>At this moment Hungerford came up and, much to my
chagrin, I was forced to present him, cutting short our
first conversation.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Her behavior with Hungerford puzzled me. There
was not a trace of the calculated reserve which
dominated all our meetings and to which, if for a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
she forgot herself, she inevitably returned. A little jealousy
sprang up in me, for I was quite blind then to the
real reason. I felt that in me there was some lack of spontaneous
appeal to a woman. Before the irresistible good
spirits of the younger man I felt a heaviness of experience
and wondered why in all my attempts at friendship I
should be so constantly saying the things that sent her
into the shell of her reserve, when she would listen with
her grave smile to Joe’s amusing patter. I was blind,
indeed, and though I took pains to hide it, I was weakly
hurt at this unconscious camaraderie with another.</p>

<p>She consented to our accompanying her in her walks
when Joe assumed it as a matter of course, though she
did refuse, and I remember it with a secret delight, to
permit him the privilege alone. Here again her personality
dominated us. When Hungerford, with the free
and easy catch-as-catch-can manner of the younger generation,
started to assume possession of her arm, she
disengaged herself quietly, and said:</p>

<p>“Messieurs, if you will offer me <i>your</i> arms.”</p>

<p>Any one but Hungerford would have been discountenanced.
As it was, though he was a bit flustered, he gave
her an exaggerated sweep of his hat.</p>

<p>“Style Louis XIV, Marquise!”</p>

<p>And, with her hands resting lightly on our arms, we
adapted our impulsive strides to the leisurely grace of
her choosing. Whatever her reason for assuming the
name and position she did (I had never believed in it
from the first), it was by such little things as this that
she betrayed the quality of her breeding. Brinsmade and
Peter Magnus were drawn to her instinctively, and often
in the long afternoons we formed a circle of animated
discussion. The opportunities to talk to her alone were
rare and always she avoided them. When I did find a
moment’s intimacy it was always to be made aware of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
the ever present sadness back of her eyes and the weight
of some oppressing memory.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The afternoon after her first introduction to Hungerford,
a curious incident happened, which, to this day,
remains inexplicable to me. For neither of us ever after
referred to it.</p>

<p>We were walking the upper deck, under the open sky,
the crisp tingling air setting our cheeks to glowing.
Despite herself, she was smiling at Hungerford’s whimsical
instructions on American society, while I, feeling a
little out of it, walked silently at her side, wondering at
the ease with which Joe had plunged into her acquaintance.</p>

<p>“And remember, in America, a young lady of fashion,
who is properly brought up, never marries until she has
had a dozen proposals.”</p>

<p>“Never?”</p>

<p>“Never. It isn’t done. Oh, American girls are brought
up to take care of themselves! When she is bored, do
you think she waits for the men to come round? Not at
all: she goes to the ’phone and says: ‘Jack, come up and
take me out to dinner and a show; I want to be amused’.”</p>

<p>“And she pays the bill?” said Mademoiselle Duvernoy
innocently.</p>

<p>“The what?”</p>

<p>“The bill.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle&mdash;I am living in hopes&mdash;”</p>

<p>At this moment a gust of wind caught a large woman
and bore her down the deck, screaming for help. Hungerford
dashed ahead, while we, sheltering ourselves in
the lee of a lifeboat, stood laughing at the difficulties of
the rescue. A sailor passed us and then a boy, carrying
a pot of grease, slipped, and, to save himself, caught at
my arm. When I had righted him, I saw such an expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
of astonishment on his face as he gazed at Mademoiselle
Duvernoy that I said, still laughing:</p>

<p>“I say, this young fellow seems to know you.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Eh, Bonne Dame; que c’est notre Mamzelle!</i>”</p>

<p>She turned, and her face went blank: then, recovering
herself, she said something rapidly in the Breton dialect
which I could not understand. The effect was instantaneous.
The boy drew up straight, snatched off his
cap, and with marks of great respect backed away.</p>

<p>“Take my arm,” I said, going to her instantly.</p>

<p>She made no resistance and once as we started she
swayed against my side. We crossed the deck and I
found her a seat where she was sheltered from sight.
There was no mistaking the effect on her. The lips were
twitching, and the lines under her staring eyes were
quivering with a haunting pain.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to speak. Don’t worry. No one saw you&mdash;not
even I. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur&mdash;” She tried to speak and then put her
hand to her throat.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to explain. Believe me, it isn’t necessary.”</p>

<p>She looked up at me, weak and shaken, and for the
first time that I remembered her eyes held mine in a
long, searching, mute appeal.</p>

<p>“But you will think&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Let me be your friend that far, Mademoiselle,” I
said impulsively. “Trust me. I have forgotten.”</p>

<p>Hungerford swung around the deck and stopped short.</p>

<p>“Hello. What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“Too much motion, you unfeeling brute, or perhaps
the sight of your gyrations.”</p>

<p>I sent him for a chair and rugs, which gave her time
to regain her self-control. Then I tucked her away in a
sheltered corner, without opposition. She was stunned
and did not seem to notice my presence for the long hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
during which I religiously kept my eyes from her face,
turning my back and staring over the driven waves.
Later she called to me in a voice still weak and I helped
her to the lower deck. The incident remained in my
memory, obsessing it, deepening the film of mystery which
had been about her from the first.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>IX</h3>

<p>I think the thing that impelled me irresistibly to
Mademoiselle Duvernoy was the directness and order of
her character. I knew that as she was, she had always
been, and that no future temptation could ever alter for a
moment her clear perception of her own high ideals. In
fact, I could not conceive of any such thing as temptation
even entering her life. To me, in my own consciousness
of my turbulent, shifting existence and my
distrust of to-morrow, it brought me a sense of cathedral
calm to be privileged to sit at her side and listen. I had
not the slightest thought what was awakening in me, so
simple, so natural and so unpremeditated was my impulse
towards her. Gradually, a sense of well-being and
light-heartedness came to me, for now, while I was still
aware of her struggling against me, I was also aware of
her yielding. With each morning’s greeting I felt the
night’s determination to relegate me into the safe distance
of the crowd. Yet I had but to conquer the disappointment
of her first manner and possess my soul in patience,
to have her turn to me in a new friendliness. At first
I talked, and she listened, gravely and attentively. I
spoke of impersonal things, of memories of trenches and
hospital, of my intellectual unrest and philosophic speculations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
She answered me shortly, or by a question led
me to find my own solution, but it was not until we
were three days from port that she revealed her own
thoughts and Peter Magnus was the occasion. I had
been speaking of my reluctance to return home and my
fear of the indifference to war I should find.</p>

<p>“You are never very tolerant, are you?” she said pensively.</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not,” I said, rather surprised at her
reading my character. “And yet you who are French
surely must understand the longing I have to love my
own country.”</p>

<p>“My country has been centuries in the making. Our
memories are long. In every family some one has died
that France might remain France. We are an old race.
We have lived together, been proud together, suffered
together, a long while. That does not come in a day.”</p>

<p>“No, of course not.”</p>

<p>I must have shown in my sudden abstraction something
of the indecision in my mind for, to my surprise, a note of
friendly sympathy came into her voice.</p>

<p>“Mr. Littledale, I am afraid you are going to be unhappy,
just at first. You hope for too much. Don’t be
impatient. How can your people know what we know?
You will learn, as we learned, to stand together&mdash;by
suffering.”</p>

<p>At this moment, the voice of Peter Magnus broke in
on our new mood.</p>

<p>“Then, you are glorifying war; you’ve come to that.
Admit it.”</p>

<p>Brinsmade rose from his rugs and stood before us
with an expression of utter helplessness.</p>

<p>“Here is a man who has been three months in France
and brings back nothing but war is horrible. What
am I to do with him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>Peter Magnus ensconced himself in Brinsmade’s
chair, so that we formed a group. He took off his hat
and ran his hands through his hair, which was like a
mane.</p>

<p>“When you speak of the glory of war,” he said, addressing
Mademoiselle Duvernoy directly, “I see only
the women in black, the cripples, the men who will grope
in blindness, the station filled with the agony of parting,
the homes swept by sorrow. Glory! Where is the glory
in it, if you do not wear a crown? No, no, war is horrible,
unthinkable!”</p>

<p>“Yet war is as inevitable a condition to a nation as
death is to a human being,” she said quietly. “And is
death so horrible?”</p>

<p>We three, of differing degrees of agnosticism, looked at
her, struck with the boldness of the thought. It was
Magnus who broke out:</p>

<p>“Yes, horrible! Death is horrible!”</p>

<p>“That, Monsieur, is because you have not seen how
men die: you are frightened by the mystery of the thing
you do not know. And&mdash;perhaps, in a man like you,
you see only your own death&mdash;do you not?”</p>

<p>Magnus stared at her. From the first he had been
strongly attracted to her and never failed in deference.</p>

<p>“What can you know of such a thing?” he asked incredulously.</p>

<p>“Men have died by the hundreds about me.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“You have nursed in the Red Cross?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I do not like to speak of myself. I only mention
it because we are discussing things seriously. Yes,
I have seen men die by the hundreds. Monsieur Magnus,
I have listened to many things you have said, and I wish
to tell you where you are wrong, and where all your doctrines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
will fall down. All you think of is to avoid suffering.”</p>

<p>“Yes, not only the suffering that comes from needless
sacrifice, but the unending suffering that comes from
those who must go on living. You know one thing. I
know the great mass; the suffering of those who starve
and suffocate.”</p>

<p>“You speak of the individual. I speak of the bigger
thing,&mdash;the race.” A little color came into her face
as she grew animated with her theme. “If a million men
die to-day or to-morrow, what difference does that make
to the nation, any more than the death of a single
sparrow?”</p>

<p>“I can hardly believe it is you that says such a thing!”
he said, astounded.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you don’t understand me. It is not how a
million men die but how they live that is important.”</p>

<p>“You are arguing with an individualist,” said Brinsmade.</p>

<p>“The right to live your life as you wish is to me a far
more important thing than whether half the world shall
speak English or German,” said Magnus warmly. “I
am looking from the bottom up. I know what they
think who are striving,&mdash;not how best to enjoy life,
but how to live. I know what the workers feel about
such things.”</p>

<p>“If that is true in America,” she said, seeking to moderate
the antagonism which his views aroused in her, “it
is because the peasants and the workers who have emigrated
are&mdash;how do you say?&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déracinés</i>; they have
been uprooted; they have not yet fastened to your land;
they do not love it more than they do themselves.
What you say is not true of our French people. If you
had seen our mobilization, you would have understood
what it is,&mdash;the love of country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>“I saw it in the city,” I said, breaking in, “and it is a
memory I shall never forget.”</p>

<p>“But you should have seen it in the country! The
quietness and the stillness of it all&mdash;only the tocsin
ringing in the church towers, ringing all the afternoon.
I saw it. I saw the women running to join the men in the
fields; to be together, the first thought. And I can see
the men leaving their reaping, sending back the women
to make ready their uniforms while they went, silently&mdash;always
silently&mdash;to register at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mairies</i>. And when
they went off, that night, each woman brought down something
from the store of the stockings,&mdash;a hundred, two
hundred francs. Not a woman rebelled. They put out
flower pots on the window sills and garlands of flowers
on the great locomotives; and I myself saw a little child
writing in chalk on the cars, ‘J’aime la France!’ There
have been other moments&mdash;moments of doubt and weakness&mdash;but
it is good to have seen that!” She stopped,
a little embarrassed at having been carried away by her
own enthusiasm. Then, she said more quietly: “That is
how the people of France, the people you speak of, felt.”</p>

<p>Magnus was silent a moment.</p>

<p>“It is hard to answer you, Mademoiselle,” he said,
gently. “I grant you that it is beautiful, but I maintain
that the tragic thing is that it is all so unnecessary.”</p>

<p>“No, no, it is not unnecessary. I say that France is
finer, nobler now than it was before. Sacrifice is the
essence of life. Suffering is the test of the finest in us.
Why won’t you admit that? Is it because you don’t believe
in anything else?”</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “I cannot believe.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is at the bottom of much of your Socialism
and your internationalism and your individualism. It is
the selfish conception of mankind. There, Mr. Magnus,
there, we disagree. We are not afraid of death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>“The Socialists and Freethinkers fought bravely, Mademoiselle,”
he said quietly, flushing under the antagonism
he felt in her voice.</p>

<p>“True,” she said, checked for a moment, “but one is
not truly agnostic when one’s mother has had faith. It
is not a question of bravery, though. That is not quite
fair,” she admitted. “Yet, I am sure I am right. If there
is no religious belief, you cannot have faith also for your
nation, can you, Mr. Brinsmade?”</p>

<p>“I had not thought of it in your way,” he said slowly.
“I am inclined to believe you are right.”</p>

<p>“I am. A Frenchman may have ceased to believe, but
he can’t get away from what has been taught him back
through his generations of ancestors. For we have
taught him duty, not as something he rebels against, but
as an ideal, something so beautiful that he is willing to
sacrifice himself to that. Also, that is why we are a
great nation; because our young men are brought up
to think of France as something outside of themselves,
that must go on, that must live,&mdash;an ideal that is not
selfish. That is what we all feel, Messieurs, from top to
bottom. What difference what happens to us, if France
remains? Oh, I express myself badly,” she broke off. “I
wish I could make you feel what we feel!”</p>

<p>“I understand your point of view, and I do respect it:
yet, Mademoiselle, there is something that I believe is
more important, and that is to see the truth. Don’t condemn
too hastily. You have the gift of faith: it is a wonderful
thing. We are unhappier, I grant you; but we
cannot change our independence. Pardon me if I am not
convinced.”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“I still maintain that when the people’s eyes are open,
they will see that they are the ones who are sacrificed.
The nationality you speak of is a beautiful thing,&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
dramatically beautiful thing. I can understand how
honor, glory, duty&mdash;those Middle Ages words&mdash;thrill
your class. But the others,&mdash;the peasant, the workman;
no, no, he fights without understanding, blindly, and he
is the one who bears the burden. For is it not true
that it is the great mass, the men in the fields and in the
streets, that bears the burden and receives nothing?”</p>

<p>She started to answer and checked herself, but immediately,
impelled by an impulse too strong to be mastered,
she said:</p>

<p>“Monsieur Magnus, it is my right to answer that. At
New Year’s, 1914, in my family, we sat down to table,
fifteen of us: my mother, my father, my five brothers,
uncles and cousins&mdash;fifteen. Five are left to-day: myself,
a brother and two cousins at the front, and a brother
who in another year will go to do his duty as a volunteer;
and, if for any reason he should seek to avoid it, we
would disown him though he were the last of our name.”</p>

<p>She said it quietly without change of voice. We
looked at her, incapable of reply. Tears started to the
eyes of Peter Magnus. He took off his hat and said
solemnly:</p>

<p>“If all the world were like you, Mademoiselle Duvernoy,
there would be no rebels like me.”</p>

<p>And, for that, I shall always maintain a respect for
Peter Magnus.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>X</h3>

<p>Later in the afternoon I came out of the smoking
room on the upper deck for a breath of fresh air. To
my surprise I had hardly started for a turn among the
rafts and lifeboats when I perceived the slender figure of
Mademoiselle Duvernoy standing by the rail. I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
to her. One glance, and I knew that her mood had been
melancholy.</p>

<p>“If you are going to indulge in the mopes&mdash;you know
what the mopes are&mdash;the blues&mdash;I refuse to leave you
alone.”</p>

<p>“But, Monsieur Littledale, I don’t see&mdash;” she began,
drawing herself up.</p>

<p>“What business it is of mine?” I said, smiling. “No,
no, you can intimidate me at other times&mdash;you do that,
you know&mdash;but not now, when I feel that you are sad,
and&mdash;please don’t go away,” I said hurriedly, as she
began to draw her cape about her. “I want to talk to
you.”</p>

<p>“But in France we don’t talk alone with young men,”
she protested, yet I noticed that she lingered.</p>

<p>“You are not in France, now, and we are not alone,”
I said, indicating a group of children who were playing
on the opposite deck.</p>

<p>She glanced in the direction of my gesture.</p>

<p>“Please, I do want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>Her look came to my eyes, the first time that her glance
had met mine openly, and in the look was gravity, friendliness,
and a shade of uncertainty. Then she looked
away, hesitating.</p>

<p>“It is a new country and a new life you are going to,
Mademoiselle,” I said quickly, “and if our ways seem
freer, you will find at the bottom that you can always
count on one thing,&mdash;the friendship and protection of
our men.”</p>

<p>“You have been very kind to me, Mr. Littledale,” she
said solemnly.</p>

<p>“I did not mean that.”</p>

<p>She did not turn her glance from the horizon, but her
head nodded twice, and a rare smile touched the corners
of her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>For the last days the air had been growing clearer,
vibrant with the vitality of younger skies: skies that
had not been drenched in the suffering of many multitudes.
In the west, the sun was falling below the green-blue
horizon that wavered in sharp outline; a magnificent
sweep of golden reds was spreading across the cloud-strewn
skies; colors of hope and exaltation, colors of
action. I, who had walked in doubts, felt the boundless
youth and opportunity which came streaming towards me
from the world of the future.</p>

<p>“It has been a privilege to meet you,” I said warmly.
“I wish I could talk over&mdash;so many things with you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I feel what is in your mind: you are torn between
two ideas&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Two? Twenty! I listen to every one; to Magnus,
who sometimes convinces me; to Brinsmade, whom I
want to believe; to twenty different points of view I pick
up in the smoking room. I want to see my way clear as
an American, to something that stands out and thrills me
as the one word ‘France’ thrills you. I want to have some
beautiful ideal of my country to live for, and I can’t yet
see what we stand for. I’ve lost all the smug, complacent
ideas I had, and I don’t see anything else clearly.”</p>

<p>“I have felt that,” she said, in her simple way, unconscious
of the intimacy into which we were drifting. “Yes,
I have felt that often as I watched your face when you
were listening to Mr. Magnus and Mr. Brinsmade.”</p>

<p>“They debate what’s going to happen to America in
a hundred years! What interests me is what’s going to
happen now.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe you will get into the war?”</p>

<p>“I hope so, from the bottom of my heart.”</p>

<p>“It will be a great awakening. We in France needed
the war, too. You see only what is glorious in us now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
You don’t know what went before. The heart of the
people was pure in the great, beautiful fields of France,
and that saved us. But we had begun to lose faith; we
even said that we were decadent, that our day had passed.
We were led by false leaders who talked to the people
of their ‘rights,’ not of their duties. And these ‘rights,’&mdash;what
were they? To do as they pleased, to seek to
make life easier. They were breaking down the faith of
the people, the faith in the family, with their right to
live each for himself; the faith in France, with their internationalism;
and their faith in God, which is at the
bottom of it all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so you said.”</p>

<p>“You do not believe?” she said, turning to me.</p>

<p>“I hope,” I said, after a moment’s pause.</p>

<p>“That may be enough for you, for you have traditions,
traditions founded in faith. But is that enough for the
people?”</p>

<p>“Magnus says it is just what keeps them from progressing.”</p>

<p>“How does he say that?”</p>

<p>“He says that the Church is a superstition worked in
the interests of property. When the Church tells them
that the reward will come in another life, it blinds them
to what they can accomplish in this if they would organize
and act.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Magnus is honest and logical, because he does
not believe,” she said, to my surprise. “Those who are
not honest with themselves are those who try to stand
halfway.”</p>

<p>“But how would you answer him?” I said, troubled.</p>

<p>“By his own argument. If there is no future life, and
therefore no faith, why should we not do anything we
please&mdash;steal, murder; why should we abide by any
law?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>“But he would supplant that by devotion to the Common
State,” I said, rather awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that just what the Prussians are doing, with all
their pretensions of calling on God? Isn’t that why we
hate the Prussian idea and resent it, because it has no
faith, either in the sacredness of one’s word or in the
feelings of humanity? Isn’t it founded on the idea of
force, and isn’t that what would result from any State
formed on agnosticism? Force, and only force, would
prevail.”</p>

<p>“But would it?”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t it? Take our own Revolution: what happened?
Didn’t it produce worse tyrants, men of force,&mdash;Marat,
Robespierre? And what killed the Revolution?
The attempt to destroy faith, in the abolishing of
religion. You see, you are questioning yourself as though
faith were only a spiritual speculation. It is much more
than that, Mr. Littledale: it is the beginning and end of
all political organization. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“When you speak, it is easy to be convinced,” I said,
yielding to the honesty in her eyes and the impassioned
ring of her voice.</p>

<p>The discussion had carried her out of herself. The
stiff preciseness had gone. Her words, warm and glowing,
thrilled me. It was not that she convinced me of
what she said but that she convinced me of herself. I
felt the woman in her, swept by generous impulses, glowing
with a beautiful ideal,&mdash;a great nature, with so
much need to give. She checked herself.</p>

<p>“Pardon. I am perhaps speaking too frankly.”</p>

<p>“No, no, you could never do that.”</p>

<p>I waited her pleasure, wishing to speak but finding no
words, afraid of the interruption which might come.</p>

<p>“I wonder what you were like before? I cannot see
you in your home. But I feel you have changed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>She said it without looking at me, hardly aware that she
had spoken her thoughts aloud.</p>

<p>“Yes, great changes&mdash;so great that it is hard to look
back and understand myself. The first night there on
the deck&mdash;you remember&mdash;I could not sleep, and I
kept going back over what I had been. You, too; I felt
you were awake, feverishly awake. Was I right?” She
nodded, but without looking at me. “I rebelled at going
back! Oh, that’s what war does for you. Whether you
hate it or love it, it ends by creating about you a new life
and the other becomes something incredible, something
you wish to forget, something you don’t wish to interfere
with your liberty of action. For, Mademoiselle, the
thing that’s hard at first is to build up for yourself a
new life that will satisfy, a new philosophy; a new code
of morals,&mdash;something to die with, not to live by. All
that is so different from the other thing that I have seen
men at my side who loved their homes shrink from opening
a letter. For when you have prepared yourself to die
it is hard to remember how you have lived. That was
what I was rebelling against,&mdash;the thought of going
back, taking up life again, only to have to go through
all the mental pain of readjustment.”</p>

<p>“You are going back?” she said, turning to me in
surprise.</p>

<p>“I am on a furlough only.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know&mdash;I did not realize.”</p>

<p>“You ask if there have not been great changes in my
life? Many, so that I wonder what is coming. Up to the
present, my life has been without meaning, and I have
only just realized it. It’s the change&mdash;the contrast: the
coming back has opened my eyes. It’s been drifting&mdash;just
drifting&mdash;nothing else. I don’t suppose I had an
idea that was really my own or that I had thought out.
Was it my fault, or the education they gave me? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
don’t know. I went through school and college, with a
nice collection of hand-picked acquaintances, wafted
gently from one exclusive club to another. In the course
of things I would have married in my own set a charming,
irreproachable girl&mdash;a spoiled child, with entirely too
much money&mdash;and settled down to the weary task of
warding off boredom. Why I didn’t do it, I don’t know.
A curious, rebellious pride, perhaps. I went abroad,
to Paris, two years. Well, I came through that! I do
not see them clearly yet or their relation to my life. They
may have been necessary: time only will tell. I only
know that the mobilization was like an escape into pure
air. The rest? Just an acceptance of a thing that can’t
be changed,&mdash;a happiness in finding some purpose.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, all this has made you what you are,” she
said, directly. “I did feel much of this. I felt this restlessness
in you. And I think I know what you are going
to do. You have qualities of the heart that will make
you see clearly in the end; the qualities of the heart are
sounder, truer than the qualities of the mind; make no
mistake. Will you tell me about her? The young girl?”</p>

<p>“May I?” We had drawn a little together and stood
looking over the rail at the tumbling swirl below. “After
all, why not?” I added, hesitating.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, sometimes it is easier to speak of the deep
things in our hearts to some one we meet just for a moment
and never see again, when each is true of heart and
understands.” She turned and a smile touched her lips,&mdash;a
smile of dignity and friendliness. “I should not
ask it if I did not think, if I did not feel very strongly,
that I might help you to see a little clearer. She loves
you, does she not?”</p>

<p>I did not realize then how strange the conversation
was, nor the sudden intimacy that drew us together.</p>

<p>“It is easy to tell you anything, Mademoiselle,” I said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
smiling back into her eyes. “But the situation is not
just what you think. Do you believe in marriage without
love?”</p>

<p>“I believe&mdash;we are taught to believe&mdash;that love
should follow marriage,” she said, hesitating. “And if
both are loyal&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That is your tradition; it is not ours. And you&mdash;is
it always possible for you to control your hearts?”</p>

<p>“We are taught that such love can only mean tragedy
and unhappiness,” she answered, staring away from me.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, it is Mr. Brinsmade’s daughter.” She
looked up at this, startled. “We have grown up together.
She is charming. I admire and respect her.
Once, I thought it was a little more than that. But&mdash;but
I do not love her. Let me tell you all. It would
mean everything to me&mdash;power, opportunity, a big life&mdash;and
Mr. Brinsmade would like it.” Then I told her
of our conversation, as best I could remember. “And
now, to be honest, I think&mdash;I believe that she cares for
me and&mdash;yet I do not love her.”</p>

<p>“Your pride is very strong,” she said solemnly.</p>

<p>“I suppose it is.”</p>

<p>She considered a long moment before she began to
speak.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I feel, no matter what you may think to-day,
your happiness lies there. The question of money
is what makes it difficult to you, but it is a question that
should not come into it at all. Mr. Brinsmade is right.
Money is opportunity, to be utilized or to be thrown
away. He is a man with big ideas, a man who goes
forward, and you will go forward with him. I do feel I
understand your nature more than you do yourself, perhaps.
You need stability in life, a home, and a woman
who loves you. A woman who is true, loyal and loves
you, you will love in the end, believe me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, do you believe that you can make
yourself love?”</p>

<p>“There are many kinds of love, Monsieur Littledale:
loves that destroy us and wreck our lives; loves that pass;
loves that we must fight down to be true to ourselves;
but there is another love which is calm and security,
which comes from mutual respect, the love that comes
with sharing life together loyally; and that love will
come later to you, for you have the qualities of the heart
that count.”</p>

<p>“To some, to some brought up in different traditions,
perhaps,” I said rebelliously. “But with myself&mdash;no.”</p>

<p>“Wait, the young girl is a woman, a charming woman
now, and all the advantages are in her hands.”</p>

<p>“It is of course what I should do,” I said, shrugging my
shoulders. Then, all at once, the incongruity of it struck
me, and I broke into a laugh. “After all, there is one
thing we forget.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“That all such things are quite unimportant: in a few
months’ time I go back. It is not a time to be making
such decisions.”</p>

<p>“You will come through safely, Monsieur Littledale,”
she said, in a tone of deep conviction. “I know it. I
feel it. I have strange intuitions sometimes. I see storm
and trouble ahead but I see the end in happiness for you.”
She could not have realized the gentleness which came
into her voice. I knew that the secret of her change of
manner was the introduction of a third. Was I altogether
honest in permitting a serious discussion, for no
thought of such a marriage was then in my mind. I
watched her face eagerly, wondering at the gentle womanliness
that came out of its hidden cell,&mdash;all unconsciousness
and simplicity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>“And your mother&mdash;what is she like?” she said.</p>

<p>“Mother? Why, I don’t know how to describe her,”
I said, in some perplexity. “I don’t know whether you’d
understand. Mother goes in for public things&mdash;very
strong on woman suffrage, charities, uplift, and pacifism.
She’s a terrific worker. She has terrific convictions&mdash;terrific!
The Governor’s a trump; a sort of country gentleman.
He’s written quite a bit; he has convictions,
too: other convictions. There’s six of us; all with convictions&mdash;separate
convictions. Oh, we’d amuse you.
A typical American family.”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“That seems so strange; but don’t your families stand
together?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one thing unites us,” I said, with a laugh.
“We agree on our right to disagree.”</p>

<p>She frowned in some perplexity.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I understand a home like that.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t like your French idea of home. We are all tremendously
devoted to each other but the thing you mean&mdash;the
family tradition&mdash;the standing for one definite
idea&mdash;that doesn’t exist.”</p>

<p>“Are you a happy race, I wonder?”</p>

<p>The question surprised me.</p>

<p>“I had never thought of that. I should say we are&mdash;yes&mdash;and
yet&mdash;I don’t know: perhaps we are not.
We are a nation of individualists, full of driving energy
and ambition. We all want something we haven’t got.
I’m afraid it’s rather a material ambition, usually. I’d
like to believe it makes for the greatness of the country,&mdash;this
restlessness, this discontent, this wanting to push
up: but perhaps we do sacrifice a good deal to it. I
haven’t thought over that much.”</p>

<p>“I think that what makes my nation truly great is that
we are the happiest people in the world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t think I quite understand you.”</p>

<p>“Everything is so well ordered with us,” she said, and
her voice softened as she spoke of loved things. “Just
as our beautiful land is so well ordered: the fields so
well laid out, the trees so well disciplined, the little, red-topped
villages so clean and so prosperous, so in harmony.
Just so in our family life: it is so well ordered.
We have real grandmothers and real grandchildren, and
our fathers are real heads of the family. I don’t think
a Frenchwoman would want to have a husband who
didn’t have authority, to whom she didn’t look up. And
our mothers&mdash;you can never know the affection, the
deference, the respect that surrounds them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that: it’s a rare and beautiful thing.”</p>

<p>“We have such pride in what the family has stood for.
We live as one, we surround the family life with so many
quaint little customs. There is much beauty and simplicity
in it, for we are willing to be happy as our grandfathers
have been happy; and that happiness is not
selfish; it means many, many sacrifices often, but that
makes it true happiness because we cannot be happy unless
we keep our pride in our ideals.” She stopped. “I
don’t know if you understand me, but I think we study
how to live more than you do. And, because we French
are so happy together, we can give everything to keep that
happiness undefiled and pass it down to our children.”</p>

<p>“Tell me of yourself&mdash;of your life,” I said, strangely
moved.</p>

<p>She drew back, as though she had been unaware of a
listener. The change was so instantaneous that it startled
me.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;Monsieur&mdash;certain things I cannot discuss&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yet you asked me the same questions, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I? But I&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>She was thrown into confusion&mdash;at loss for an answer&mdash;and,
all at once, her face went red.</p>

<p>“I only want you to understand, Mademoiselle,” I
said, with kindness, “that it seemed a natural thing. It
was not an impertinence. I could never be impertinent
to you.”</p>

<p>“You make me feel&mdash;” She hesitated again. “I am
sorry&mdash;I didn’t realize. But you made me talk. It were
better I should not; I knew I should not.”</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, why not?”</p>

<p>“I do not want to hurt you, Monsieur Littledale. You
have been so kind, so generous; but you make me do
things I don’t want to do,&mdash;things that are against my
traditions, for I am traveling alone, unprotected&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Duvernoy, I shall consider it a great
privilege to be your friend now and hereafter.”</p>

<p>“That cannot be; it is not possible; it is not right. We
go different ways in the world.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We go different ways,” she repeated firmly. “If you
will be generous, you will not ask any more&mdash;please.”</p>

<p>She ended so low that it came to me in a whisper.</p>

<p>“I can be generous, but not to that point,” I said
obstinately. “I want another answer.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Littledale, we are just chance acquaintances,”
she said, bringing her hands together in impulsive
entreaty. “There is no reason&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I do not believe we are what you say. It was something
more than that which brought me to your side that
first night here.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>She turned to me, with startled eyes.</p>

<p>“The feeling that made me know you were in&mdash;in
danger.”</p>

<p>“In danger!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>“In danger, Mademoiselle. I felt it so strongly that
it sent me to you, and I did not dare leave you alone.”</p>

<p>I had no sooner said it than I realized how profoundly
and fatally I had erred. The woman who faced me I had
never seen before.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, you do not know me. I am not of a race
of cowards. I do not take a coward’s way out of life.”</p>

<p>I looked at her, without power to answer,&mdash;amazed
and baffled by the swift succession of emotions which
had culminated in this erect and scornful pride. My
eyes dropped before the look.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” I said, at last. “I have offended you,
I have offended you, when my only thought, from the
moment I met you, has been to offer you all my friendship
and deference. I am profoundly and miserably sorry.”</p>

<p>I left her and went down the deck to the farther rail.
There was no resentment towards her,&mdash;only a weak,
sinking misery that I should have wounded her. My ears
were filled with the sound of her gentleness. I remembered
only the hurt pride in her eyes. I saw her face in
the mists of the twilight, her deep eyes looking gravely
out at me.</p>

<p>“Good God! How could she think I would say or do
word or deed to hurt her!” I said to myself, again and
again.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Littledale?”</p>

<p>Unperceived, she had come to me. She was there,
waiting at my side.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Littledale, I am sorry, too.”</p>

<p>Her hands were clasped before her, and the eyes that
looked to me in compassion and forgiveness were blurred.
I put out my hands blindly, but she had fled. I stood
there, hearing nothing, seeing nothing, my heart pounding
within me.</p>

<p>It was then I knew that I loved her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>XI</h3>

<p>She was not down to dinner when I came eagerly into
the crowded <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>. She was not on the deck when I
hurried up, nor did she appear again that night. I slept
badly and was out with the dawn, making endless rounds
through the sailors, who were swabbing down the decks.</p>

<p>I knew that I was beginning to love her, nor was I so
dull as not to feel that to her, too, I was more than just
a chance acquaintance. I did not attempt to analyze my
feelings or to penetrate the future. The present hour was
too imperious. My mood was not of exultation but of
fear of her shy and persistent avoidance of me. If only
a week were before us! But the day was the last, and
the morrow would bring America, and&mdash;separation. I
think I did not realize the full force of the emotion that
had swept over me; nor all the complexities, the
hazards, and the tragic destiny that it had, in the
twinkling of an eye, laid upon my life. My only thought
was to see her again to know from her first look that
I still retained what had come to us in the dusk before.
I knew that everything was horribly against me.
I was certain, for some reason I could not fathom, that
she would resist me, had resisted me from the first. I
was sure of nothing. But though it meant finally but
emptiness and the struggle to forget, I was powerless to
draw back now.</p>

<p>Breakfast passed, and the morning drew out, and she
did not come. I went to my chair and threw myself
down, bodily and mentally tired. A vast feeling of depression
possessed me. Magnus came and talked to me.
I was conscious of seeming to listen; I caught phrases,
heard myself making responses. I knew nothing. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
heart sank within me and such a feeling of physical weakness
possessed me, in this new, utter sense of loneliness,
that I could do no more than lie there, stretched inertly,
saying again and again to myself:</p>

<p>“She will not come. I have frightened her away.”</p>

<p>Yet she had not passed the door before I was instantly
aware of it. A wave of happiness and well-being went
through me, as though my lungs had filled with the first
life-giving breath of air. She was coming, head down and
walking fast. I sprang up and hurried to relieve her of
the rug she was carrying. I knew she saw me, for she
wavered and turned aside to speak to a little French-woman
who was traveling with her baby.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, Monsieur.”</p>

<p>“May I take your rug?”</p>

<p>She glanced at her arm as though she had just perceived
its burden.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Monsieur.”</p>

<p>I went to her chair and prepared it for her coming. All
the depression had left me at the first glance into her
gray eyes. She, too, had felt the tumult and the turmoil;
it was written there in weariness and strain. A violent
joy, a sense of living and of hope, surged up in me, as I
awaited her first words. When I turned she had taken
the arm of her companion and was silently pacing off the
deck.</p>

<p>An intuition, the instinct born of the struggle which
is inseparable from love, came to me. I, too, would avoid
her and, in my absence, in the longing denied, she would
suffer, too, and by that suffering come closer to me.
Cruel? Yes, as in such moments the impulse is to beat
down all obstacles, to contend without quarter for the
happiness that lies beyond the agony of doubt and disbelief!
I rose and went into the smoking room, steeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
myself to patience, resolved not to leave it until luncheon.
I sat there ten, fifteen, twenty minutes. At the end of
a half-hour I could bear it no longer. I went out hurriedly
and, all my resolutions forgot, straight to where
she waited in her chair.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, you have not forgiven me,” I said,
without preliminaries.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>She turned, startled, and the new conflict I saw in the
haunted weariness of her glance brought me a sense of
coming victory.</p>

<p>“Because you avoid me.”</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>She could not meet the direct challenge of my look and
turned away. Still I pursued, without compassion.</p>

<p>“Yes. You avoid me. Would you rather that I did
not remain here?” I asked suddenly, sure of her answer.
“For nothing in the world would I do anything that would
be distasteful to you. Tell me only what you wish. Shall
I go?”</p>

<p>She hesitated and, before the trouble I felt in her, my
resolve almost gave way. Yet, because I was fighting
for both of us, I held firm.</p>

<p>“Only tell me what you wish.”</p>

<p>Once or twice she seemed to make up her mind to
speak, but each time she checked herself.</p>

<p>“Do you realize that by this time to-morrow we shall
be steaming up New York harbor?”</p>

<p>“This time to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“This time to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She put down the book she held in her hands with a
show of purpose, and looked out gravely.</p>

<p>“A strange world to both of us,” I said.</p>

<p>To my annoyance, the sound of the gong began to
rumble through the ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>“What&mdash;already?” she said, to my delight, looking
incredulously at her watch.</p>

<p>“Take your luncheon up here; it’s a perfect day.”</p>

<p>“What a good idea! Yes, I think I shall.”</p>

<p>I hesitated, all my assurance melting away.</p>

<p>“I suppose the terrible gods of French etiquette would
rock on their thrones if I stayed, too&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I should feel very conspicuous.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course. I knew you would feel that
way.”</p>

<p>My tone fell, in such unconcealed chagrin that she
could not help noticing it. She sat up and glanced down
the deck. Other groups, yielding to the sunlight which
poured over the dancing ocean and flung rainbows in the
spray, were preparing to picnic above.</p>

<p>“It is the last day,” I repeated.</p>

<p>“Please&mdash;I should like if you will stay,” she said, all
at once, and then blushed and looked away.</p>

<p>I affected not to notice her confusion and busied myself
with a serious contemplation of the menu.</p>

<p>“There, it’ll be just like a meal at the front! Not
quite so good cooking as at one of your little country
inns. Do you know, what you said the other day’s been
in my mind?”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“About seeing death at first hand. I didn’t feel the
way you did. I was all broken up the first time; couldn’t
sleep for a week. And yet, you Frenchwomen go through
all that and can still smile. Why is it? Have we weaker
nerves?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think there is something changed in our
smiles?” she said, looking up.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I feel that. But you have so much faith in
the good of the world, you seem so uplifted by your experience,
there is something so serene in your eyes&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>I stopped, realizing how personal my analysis was
growing.</p>

<p>“Ah, but when you are not just a spectator, when you
are helping, it is different. What is uplifting in service
is that your own self becomes of such little importance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I should think your memories&mdash;” I broke
off. “When you told that fairy tale to Master Jack, the
first day, you could even laugh.”</p>

<p>“It’s because what I remember is not pain and ugliness
but only the beauty of sacrifice and the nobility of men
who at other times may have been very sordid,” she said
warmly. “Do you know what our memories are?” She
half closed her eyes, and a tender look touched her lips.
“I think of one Christmas Eve&mdash;a great barn where I
was nursing&mdash;a barn that had been improvised into a
hospital, with beds in the straw, just like the birthplace
of the little Saviour. I don’t like to speak of myself, but
I will tell you this. We stayed&mdash;my mother and I&mdash;in
a little village on the frontier&mdash;our village&mdash;when the
Germans came through; and that village, our little village,
changed hands six times.”</p>

<p>“And you stayed&mdash;you and your mother?”</p>

<p>“We stayed, not to abandon our people and to take
care of our poor wounded.”</p>

<p>“And they let you do that?”</p>

<p>“They needed some one to take care of their own,” she
said, with a frown, “and we agreed&mdash;my mother and I&mdash;to
do that if we could be permitted to nurse our own
men. Six times the village changed hands, but on
that night&mdash;Christmas Night&mdash;it was ours. So we
made ready to celebrate. We organized a concert. Oh,
it was a strange concert! There were over a hundred
wounded in that great barn, and only a dozen could stand
on their legs, but they were all so gay, for that is something
our brave little <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilus</i> never lose,&mdash;their gaiety.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
And there was to be a tree, and all sorts of funny presents.
And the concert! There was a quartet, and there
was a waiter from the Café de Paris who was lying in a
stall&mdash;with his feet carried off&mdash;who was to sing comic
songs, and a real tenor from the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Conservatoire</i>, who
would sing magnificent arias from the opera, and then
there was to be a comic recitation, and a classic recitation.
Every one quite forgot their troubles in the excitement.
But Christmas morning a dozen wounded were
brought in, and one, a sergeant of chasseurs, in such a
dreadful state that we did not think he would live through
the day. So of course, we prepared to give up the celebration:
and what do you think? He heard the men
talking, and he sent for me.</p>

<p>“‘Mademoiselle, is it true you are giving up the concert
on my account?’</p>

<p>“‘You are in a bad way, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon petit</i>!’ I told him.</p>

<p>“‘Bad way! <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Allons!</i> I am going to die,’ he broke out.
‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Eh, bien!</i> I choose to die gaily, instead of in a corner,
like a dog. It is my wish that the concert go on. And
tell the comrades to sing out good and strong!’</p>

<p>“It was done, as he wished.”</p>

<p>“And he died?”</p>

<p>“Not that day, but the next,” she said, “without a
complaint. Do you think that when I can remember there
are men like that in France, I have a right to be sad?”</p>

<p>The deck steward came and went, and we began our
luncheon. A hundred questions were on my tongue, but
I gave voice to none.</p>

<p>“They were so patient and so simple in their courage,”
she continued gravely, “always trying to help me. Many
times, I’ve had a soldier who was suffering say to me:</p>

<p>“‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Allons</i>, Mam’zelle, get your sleep to-night. If this
arm of mine won’t keep quiet, I can be of some use. I’ll
make the rounds.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>“And the brave fellows who fretted because they
couldn’t return soon enough to the lines! They were so
gay. I remember a little Breton who had both legs gone,
posing for his photograph, with stockings pinned to his
trousers, and saying:</p>

<p>“‘When I get up to Paris, I’ll get a pair of legs that’ll
make me two inches taller than this old Auvergnat over
here!’”</p>

<p>“Those are the things that are good to remember.
Poor boys! There were so many that died unnecessarily!
We were so few, and we could do so little!”</p>

<p>“But you had doctors?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“I am speaking of the first months. Only from time
to time a doctor, and, when the Germans had the village,
never. But I think that was better.”</p>

<p>“I could not have done that,” I said, shaking my head.
“I think I could meet what I had to meet but&mdash;day in
and day out&mdash;to have seen others suffer, others die like
that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I only remember the look of gratitude in their eyes,”
she said, simply. “And then, I had my part. I had to
keep up their morale, you know, and send them back
to the front with courage. It would never have done for
me to weaken.” She turned with a smile and saw the
profound gravity on my face. “Believe me, what I say
is true,” she said solemnly. “It had its hardships, but
they were days of beauty, and I never think on them
without a thrill of pride in the France I have been privileged
to know. Please don’t look so grave. I’m afraid
I’ve been too serious.”</p>

<p>I was staring at her, looking into the past which she
had conjured up, divining things she had passed lightly
over.</p>

<p>“Why are you staring so?” she said, a little embarrassed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>“I was trying to imagine you in your white and blue
costume,&mdash;the most beautiful robe that has ever been
given to woman,” I said solemnly. “You have no photograph?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“I only meant I should have liked to see it.”</p>

<p>“I love the uniform, too,” she said, and a note of sadness
was in her voice.</p>

<p>“But you will go back?” I said, before I could catch
myself.</p>

<p>“I shall never go back. Will you take the tray?”</p>

<p>I hastened to obey. When I returned, I saw at once
a stiffening of her whole nature against me.</p>

<p>“Confess that you are thinking of the sacred gods of
French etiquette,” I said, hoping to make her smile.</p>

<p>She acknowledged the hit, with a little confusion.</p>

<p>“Then please blame me, and not your conscience, for
I made you talk.”</p>

<p>“That is so. You make me talk against my will.”</p>

<p>“And now you are wondering how you can run away.”</p>

<p>“How do you know me so well?” she said, forced at
last into a smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do. There is a very stern, uncompromising
Mademoiselle Duvernoy, and there is a very gay, happy
Mademoiselle Duvernoy.”</p>

<p>“Once, there was a very frivolous one,” she said,
nodding.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But it is so; oh, very frivolous&mdash;very <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mondaine</i>, before
the war&mdash;who loved good things, as a child loves
sugar plums!”</p>

<p>“What terrible sins you must have had on your conscience!”
I said, laughing.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I loved pleasure, very much, and the things
of this world. I did, very much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>I smiled.</p>

<p>“I smile, as the Father who heard your confession must
have smiled.”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“I was a very superficial little person; not at all tolerant,
very satisfied with myself, and very dissatisfied
with others.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens; I don’t think you have ever been
anything but the spirit of gentleness!” I broke out.</p>

<p>She drew back instantly, and I hastened to repair the
blunder my impulsiveness had made.</p>

<p>“You women of France all have that quality of gentleness,”
I said hastily, in a more guarded tone. “That
is what I notice about all of you.”</p>

<p>She relaxed, though not quite convinced.</p>

<p>“You idealize me, Monsieur. We have done our duty,
that is all, and we have found in it a great happiness.”</p>

<p>“I wish my sister&mdash;I used to think of her as my little
sister; good heavens, she must be twenty now!&mdash;I wish
my sister Molly could know you. Of all the family, she
is closest to me. I hate to think of her going through
four or five years of useless life, dancing herself to death,
learning to get bored with every pleasure: she’s such a
little trump, now.” I took out my pocketbook and
brought out a photograph of a youngster in pigtail, tanned
and straight, looking out with innocent laughter at the
most beautiful of worlds.</p>

<p>She took it, and glanced from the photograph to me.</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand. There is something very noble,
very pure, very brave. She is your favorite?”</p>

<p>I began to laugh.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Do you know, that’s only the second time I think
you’ve really looked me in the eyes.”</p>

<p>She blushed&mdash;as she did easily&mdash;and tried to laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p>“We are told never to look a man in the eyes. It is
very old-fashioned to you?”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“Because,” she hesitated a little and then went on,
looking away from me, “because, when you look in a
man’s eyes, they say, you are seeking a different meaning
to his words.” She blushed furiously. “It’s not that
exactly but&mdash;how shall I say?&mdash;we are taught that it
is too forward&mdash;too provocative. But you are laughing
at me,” she said, covered with confusion.</p>

<p>“I am not laughing, Mademoiselle,” I said seriously,
“and I like that in you.”</p>

<p>The conversation became difficult and a certain diffidence
overcame us. A moment before, she had been talking
to me freely and impulsively, though a little shy and
hesitant, as a young girl. I saw her mood change and a
certain womanly dignity come to her.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I have been thinking much of the confidence
you entrusted to me. Have you&mdash;have you no
photograph of Miss Brinsmade?”</p>

<p>My pocketbook was still in my hand. I drew out a
little snapshot and handed it to her. She held it a long
time, studying it intently.</p>

<p>“She is very beautiful,” she said at last.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“This is how long ago?”</p>

<p>“Three&mdash;four years; when she was just out of
school.”</p>

<p>She nodded, still studying it.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, there is a great deal that is waiting there&mdash;a
great deal of love&mdash;a great deal of nobility. A
woman like that will be what you want her to be; only,
don’t make her wait too long.”</p>

<p>I took the photograph, looked at it wondering if she had
said all her thought, and slowly replaced it in my pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, I, too, have been thinking over our
conversation and I feel I may have given you a wrong
impression&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“I was only discussing something that was a remote
possibility, nothing that I have really considered.
I reproach myself a little; I had not the right&mdash;on her
account.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I know now that it is quite impossible.”</p>

<p>Heavens, how much I wished to say to her, and how
little I dared. I waited, wondering if she would understand.
She did not answer, but I saw her hands clasp
and unclasp in her lap.</p>

<p>“What you have said of marriage is natural to your
traditions. Some other man might do as you suggest and
find happiness. I know&mdash;I know I could not, and keep
my self-respect. I shall never marry, Mademoiselle, unless
my whole heart goes with it.” I hesitated and, despite
myself, knowing the danger of it, I added, very low,
“I know that now.”</p>

<p>She did not hesitate but answered me, instantly and
lightly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Monsieur, the future will settle that. Will
you permit me to hope that it may be so?”</p>

<p>She rose, with a formal nod and made a pretext to descend
to her cabin. I saw her to the door and returned,
my brain in a whirl. At one moment she had seemed to
come to me with such impulsiveness; at the next, to be
a thousand miles away. I dropped back into my chair,
uneasy and tortured by regrets. A flash of gold on the
gray scarf she had left behind her caught my eye and,
leaning over, I picked up a little brooch I had always
seen at her throat. It was in the form of a locket, heart-shaped,
such as children wear. I turned it over in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
hands and saw an inscription on the back, a date and a
name written in a free hand:</p>

<p class="p1 center larger">
<i>BERNOLINE</i>
</p>

<p>The next moment I realized that unwittingly I had
trespassed on the mystery of her identity. I put the
pin hastily in my pocket and rose, with an idea to restore
it to her immediately. I went into the Ladies’
Cabin, hoping to find her there, and then into the writing
room. I could not take it, myself, to her stateroom and
I did not wish to entrust it to a steward. In the end, I
kept it and waited for her reappearance.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>XII</h3>

<p>It was well into the heart of the afternoon when I discovered
her, at her old post on the upper deck.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, please do not think that I mean to
intrude,” I said diffidently, when I had come to her side.</p>

<p>“You are not intruding, and I had hoped that you
would come,” she said, without evasion. “For, Monsieur,
I feel that I ought to say something to you very seriously.”</p>

<p>Her manner, in its decision and thoughtfulness,
alarmed me.</p>

<p>“I have things, too, which I wish to talk over with you,
in the uttermost seriousness. I am a little afraid of that
conversation,” I said, looking down, “because we are
going to disagree. My mind is made up to certain things,
Mademoiselle, and I do not think you can change it.” I
added, looking up into the sadness of her eyes, “Will you
grant me a favor&mdash;a last favor. There is so little time
that is left us. Wait until to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“My conscience reproaches me for putting it off as I
have done. Do not make it any harder.”</p>

<p>“If it is to be only a memory,” I said, “let the memory
be complete. It is something even to have had a memory
of you. Please grant my request.”</p>

<p>I doubt whether she would have yielded even then,
though I saw her breast rise and her eyes close at my
voice, had I not brought forward the locket, saying:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, I came to bring you this. I found it
on your chair.”</p>

<p>Her hand went to her dress spasmodically, and the
color left her face with the violence of her emotion.</p>

<p>“I must tell you. I did not realize what I was doing,
but I saw the name on the back.”</p>

<p>“You did not open the locket?” she said, in terror.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, I am sorry that you asked that question.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me&mdash;I&mdash;forgive me.” She put her hand
to her eyes, and stood trembling from head to foot. God
knows it was hard not to take her in my arms. But I
stood there, gritting my teeth, waiting until she grew
quiet once more.</p>

<p>“Bernoline&mdash;so that is your name?” I said softly.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is my name.”</p>

<p>“I have known, from the first. Bernoline&mdash;I am
glad I saw it, for the other name I could not associate
with you.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur.” She turned, and this time her eyes looked
me through and through. “You are a man of honor?
Give me your word of honor never to mention that name
to a human being. Oh, I do not mean to hurt you&mdash;I do
trust you. But&mdash;I must have your word!”</p>

<p>“You have hurt me,” I said. “It was not necessary,
but&mdash;you have my word.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>Her agitation was so extreme that she hardly noticed
my reply.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle&mdash;no one who has had the privilege of
knowing you&mdash;of listening to you&mdash;can ever believe
that you were brought up to be a governess. And if you
had been,” I added hastily, “that would not make the
slightest difference. You are you, and that is sufficient. I
think, Mademoiselle, I never wanted anything more in the
world than to be your friend.”</p>

<p>She shook her head again at this, but the agitation
passed and her voice was soft with pleading as she
answered me:</p>

<p>“Monsieur Littledale, you will forgive me? From the
heart? I did not know what I was saying. I should
always trust you&mdash;in everything&mdash;without a doubt.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” I said, all choked up.</p>

<p>“Your friendship? Yes. But, friends? No. To-morrow,
it is to be good-by,” she said, more gently than
I had heard her. “Is it not better to say now what we
must say to each other?”</p>

<p>“No, no&mdash;to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, then. Since you asked it and because I
did hurt you,” she answered. “Only, make no mistake.
You have seen me, Monsieur, in moments of weakness.
Why I have been so I do not know: I am not like that.
I can do what has to be done.” The locket was in her
hands; she held it before her. “It is the last thing that
remains of all my past life. I had no right to keep it;
I have been wrong. Monsieur Littledale, I think you will
understand now how immovable my resolution is, when
I know what must be done!”</p>

<p>She opened her hand, and the locket, a tiny streak
of gold, vanished into the sea.</p>

<p>“It was my baby pin, and the name was in the handwriting
of my father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>It was done without a tremor and the chill of the
waters, into which the locket had passed, possessed me.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Instinctively we avoided the danger of personal references.
For the rest of the afternoon we sat there together,
talking eagerly, unconscious as two children of
the shortening day. I do not remember ever to have
known such an exquisite and eager pleasure as in this
impulsive searching of our minds. It was the delight in
meeting in intimate conversation some one who woke
in me all my dormant imagination and led me along suddenly
opening galleries, into unsuspected worlds. As we
rambled on, touching lightly or profoundly twenty changing
ideas, a deep tranquillity came to my restless spirit,
not simply from the contemplation of the serenity that
lay on her open forehead and deep in her clear, untroubled
eyes, nor the charm of listening to the melody of her
voice, but in the calm certitude of coming happiness. I
was happy; yes, for that one all too brief afternoon. I
was happy as I never realized happiness could come to
me. For I saw such happiness in her face that at times
she seemed no more than a girl of sixteen, artlessly
spreading before me her imagination and her treasured
thoughts. She was happy. I knew what that meant. I
was content to go no further, sure that on the morrow,
when we came to serious discussion, I could turn all her
objections, based, as I believed them to be, on a sentiment
of too scrupulous pride.</p>

<p>We were in the midst of a gay debate on the upbringing
of the young girl in France, when the sound of the
dinner gong broke in on our illusions.</p>

<p>“What, so soon!”</p>

<p>“It is not possible!”</p>

<p>The two cries came simultaneously. We stood up,
suddenly sobered. I saw her face change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>“And, to-morrow afternoon&mdash;here,” I said confidently.</p>

<p>“It were better to say good-by now,” she said wearily.</p>

<p>“It will not be good-by, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>She shook her head and gave me her hand, and I remember
now how heavily it lay for that short second in
mine.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I repeat, you make me do things I do
not mean to do, that I have no right to do.”</p>

<p>“Wait until to-morrow,” I said, so completely happy
that I tried to laugh her out of her mood and refused to
perceive the solemnity and sadness that settled over her
face.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I am glad now, as I look back, for that one hour of
absolute faith in the future. Life was a certainty; I was
filled with an eagerness to begin and in the knowledge
of the rare and beautiful realization of happiness, I had
not the slightest fear of the test of the morrow.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>I spent the hours after supper in the smoking room,
puffing at my pipe, with a new tolerant understanding of
the young America before me; of these young spirits, with
their exaggerated bursts of humor, their overflowing belief
in themselves, their boyish eagerness to return to
“God’s Country.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if they would ever agree on anything,” I
thought, as I watched the nervous, combustible American
need of reaction breaking out in sudden fits of gaiety.
“So many minds; so many ideas!”</p>

<p>Some had served from curiosity, more from the love
of adventure, and a few, thrilled by the comprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
of noble ideals. I saw them returning, scattering north,
south, and west; into village, farm and city; mechanics,
students, idlers; taking up again the easy, careless run
of American lives; moving on obedient to the accidents
which determined their paths; good-natured, generous,
emotional, keen, ambitious, seeking that success that is
counted in terms of dollars. And then I wondered. I
wondered if the sudden, transforming call on the air would
ever come to them.</p>

<p>“What does it matter whether a million men die to-day
or next year?”</p>

<p>Bernoline’s words, words that had startled me at
first, came back to me then. “All that matters is how
they live!”</p>

<p>“For, if the test come,” I thought, “it is our generation
that’ll have to make good. Make good! Yes, that’s one
thing we can do: I have no fear of that&mdash;and yet, how
unprepared we are for the test!”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The next morning I was up and out on deck with the
sun. Already there was the note of change. The dream
life of the last days, suspended between sea and sky, between
one civilization and another in a happy incredulity,
was come to an end. Ahead was reality; life to be taken
up again, the fixed path to be followed!</p>

<p>Forward, the hatches were off and the donkey engines
were diving into the holds. The passengers who came out
were unrecognizable in their shore clothes, stiff and formal,
retreating into the shells of themselves. The smoke
of an ugly freighter smirched the sky. A swarm of
sea gulls, noisy as the approaching multitudes of the
city, vexed the air. Across the lapping of shallower
waters a dozen sails stood out to sea. At noon Fire
Island rose out of the waves, passed and sank. A group
on the deck below set up a cheer. The thin, white sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
of Long Island slipped over the horizon and grew towards
us. America&mdash;my America&mdash;was there! I felt like
snatching off my hat and waving it madly, hysterically,
as Frangipani and the others were doing.</p>

<p>I had not thought to be so stirred. I had thought to
return with foreboding in my eyes and questions on my
lips, and instead there came this involuntary gripping of
the heart. Out of the whole world, this, this bit of land
was mine!</p>

<p>“Good to see your own again, after all, isn’t it?” said
Brinsmade, who had come to my side.</p>

<p>I acknowledged it, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Had no idea it would affect me so.”</p>

<p>“It’s an instinct that’s down pretty deep, David.”</p>

<p>We watched the derricks swinging up their cargo. A
crowd of young fellows, led by Frangipani’s ear-splitting
tenor, were singing:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Give my regards to Broadway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember me to Herald Square!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“We’re all like that,” said Brinsmade. “Must blow
off steam occasionally. Would you believe it&mdash;I feel
like jumping down there and doing the same thing!”</p>

<p>“I believe you.”</p>

<p>I glanced at my watch for the twentieth time, and went
up to the upper deck and waited, scanning the horizon
that was perplexed with the drift of the great city; scows,
tugboats, coast liners and pilot boats,&mdash;a busy officious
rabble. Then Bernoline came.</p>

<p>She was gloved and bonneted, an umbrella in her
hand, veiled, as she had been on the day of departure.
My heart sank. I was quite unprepared for this. In
my rapt imagination I had expected the Bernoline of yesterday,
impulsive and generous, a woman turning back
into the eager unconsciousness of girlhood. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
more than a mask. She had retreated behind a barrier
of impersonality,&mdash;an impersonality as stiff and starched
and forbidding as the outward form.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Littledale, will you walk with me a
moment?”</p>

<p>The voice was calm, self-possessed and resolved. I
was so overcome, I had already such a sensation of futility
and defeat, that I do not know that I even acknowledged
her greeting as I turned and followed at her side.</p>

<p>“A little farther&mdash;there&mdash;here we can be alone.”</p>

<p>We crossed and found a sheltered nook. I stood, staring
down. All below me was ugliness, and I remember now
how suddenly depressed it made me to be brought face
to face with this sordid realism,&mdash;this muddy water,
streaked with oil, the waste, refuse and litter of the city.
The siren blew, once, twice, in shattering blasts. We
moved onward, towards the river head.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I have to thank you, and I do thank you
deeply for your perfect courtesy towards me.” Her
voice sank lower. “You have been loyal and considerate.
It is a memory I shall always retain of an American gentleman.
Now, I am going to appeal to that chivalry and
to that loyalty.”</p>

<p>“You are going to ask me never to see you again.”</p>

<p>She hesitated before the shock of pronouncing the decision
which must have been in her thoughts for days.
Then, recovering herself, she said, calmly:</p>

<p>“That is exactly what I must ask of you.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand&mdash;<i>must</i>?”</p>

<p>“Must.”</p>

<p>All that I had thought out, every argument which I
had built up victoriously to combat her resolution, all
power of reasoning, left me. Intuition, which never fails
at such times, told me that before this Bernoline nothing
that I could say or do would avail. The woman who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
spoke was a soul in retreat, and the veil which barred the
meeting of our eyes was the veil of renunciation. I
blurted out:</p>

<p>“Why? Why do you ask such a thing, such an unnatural
thing of me? What reason can there be?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I must remind you,” she said instantly,
“that there is no reason why I should give explanations.”</p>

<p>“Wait. I can’t talk to you like this,” I broke in.
“Yesterday&mdash;good heavens, where is yesterday?&mdash;yesterday
I knew you. Only yesterday, we were happy as
two children, exploring the world, hand in hand: to-day
you come to me and face me as though I were an enemy!
You speak to me behind this mask of a veil! You ask
me something utterly incomprehensible and, at my first
dazed question, you&mdash;but what have I done&mdash;why,
why should you take this way with me?”</p>

<p>She raised her arms instantly and drew back her veil.</p>

<p>“You are not an enemy, Monsieur Littledale.”</p>

<p>When I looked at her I was so shocked by the pallor
of her face and the dark stricken eyes that I cried involuntarily:</p>

<p>“I have made you suffer like that!”</p>

<p>“It is right that I should suffer,” she said bravely,
though her lips trembled a bit, “for I have done wrong in
even permitting you to speak to me.”</p>

<p>“Why? What wrong?” I said desperately. “What
wrong is there in our friendship? I have never said a
word to you, Mademoiselle, that could not be said before
a third person. I never shall. Leave it as it is. Keep
me in your life&mdash;as a friend, only.”</p>

<p>She shook her head, and her eyes never wavered from
mine.</p>

<p>“You make it very hard for me. Yet, because I feel
that what has happened is my fault, I must say things
that it is very hard for a woman to say. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon ami</i>, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
shall not disguise from you that, had I the right, your
devotion would mean to me the greatest happiness in
the world. Let us not play with a situation that is too
serious for half-truths. What might be cannot be. I
tell you this, and after what I have told you, my friend,
without concealment, I ask you to believe without further
question.”</p>

<p>“Good God! And what do you think I feel!”</p>

<p>“Try to forgive me&mdash;if not now, a little later. I
accuse myself bitterly. Don’t&mdash;don’t show me how
I have hurt you.”</p>

<p>“Bernoline! Bernoline! Don’t say such things.”</p>

<p>I looked away, at the world that grew blurred, and at
the sky and water, which ran together before my eyes.
Everything was against me&mdash;the minutes even, dwindling
away as we moved inexorably towards the final
parting. At one moment I rebelled against the needless
insensate pain of it all. Something in me called out:
“She is a woman&mdash;a woman that suffers as you do.
Clasp her in your arms&mdash;beat down all opposition&mdash;still
all her doubts and fears with the thing that is above
reasoning. Be cruel. It is the only way. Be cruel now,
to be happy always.”</p>

<p>But at the next moment, at the thought of all it must
have cost her to have said what she had said; at the
struggle I had seen in her eyes, just to spare her this one
added touch of pain, I was ready to accept everything
she asked as she asked it. So, I stood, struggling with
many impulses. At the end, I raised my head, and said:</p>

<p>“Bernoline, you are right: it can be no question of
friendship between us. You have done a very brave
thing. I wish I could do as big a thing. I cannot. There
is no earthly reason which I can conceive of that can
come between us. Do you think, now, after what you
have shown me, I could go away without an explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
and not be haunted by the thought of what might have
been!”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Littledale, you do not realize the difference
between our positions. I am come here to this world to
earn my living, as governess, nurse, companion, in whatever
way God will show me.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, what difference does that make to me?”</p>

<p>“It does, to me: it is a question of pride. I have
chosen my way, and I must do as others do. Are you
going to make it harder?”</p>

<p>“Bernoline, that is not the real reason,” I said sternly.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon ami</i>, there is the difference in religion&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Bernoline, that is not the real reason!”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Littledale,” she said, wavering from the
look in my eyes, “I repeat, I alone have the right to
decide, and I do not admit&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And I tell you now I will never let you go out of my
life, no matter what you may ask of me!”</p>

<p>There was a long moment before she again raised her
head.</p>

<p>“You make it very difficult for me, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>; if you
knew how difficult, I think you would be more generous.”</p>

<p>The rebellious combat in me died away before the
break in her voice. I looked, and saw her eyes closed
with sudden tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t,” I said brokenly. “Anything&mdash;anything
but that, Bernoline!”</p>

<p>“My friend, I will not lie to you,” she said, after a
moment. “If I could&mdash;if it were right&mdash;I should
prize beyond all things your friendship.”</p>

<p>“Friendship!”</p>

<p>“It cannot be. I have been wrong, very, very wrong
to have even talked to you as I have&mdash;but at moments
it was beyond my strength. I reproach myself, bitterly!
David, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>,” she said suddenly, and her hand came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
out bravely and lay on mine. “I have more than I can
bear, now. If you insist, I will tell you, but&mdash;it will
break my heart to do so. I am going to ask you, once
more. If you have the great heart I believe you have,
my friend, my good loyal friend, if you do not want me
to suffer more than I can bear to suffer, if I am to hold
to my own respect, give me your promise never to see
me again. Ask me no questions; trust me. Go your own
way and let me go mine.”</p>

<p>Her hands had come together in supplication; her eyes
had in them a terror of returning pain and their look
hung in mortal distress on my decision. Her agitation
communicated itself to me; confusion was in my eyes,
and in my heart was a chill.</p>

<p>“Good God! What can I do, when you ask me like
that?” I said helplessly. “I promise. It shall be as you
wish. I&mdash;it&mdash;I promise.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Merci, oh, mon Dieu!</i>”</p>

<p>I heard her cry like something far off; all the world
had dropped away from me. She came close to me; perhaps
my very helplessness disarmed her.</p>

<p>“David, I never meant to hurt you so. Believe me,
what I do is for you&mdash;for you, first. Keep me as a
memory of something beautiful in your life. Day and
night I shall have you in my prayers&mdash;you and your
happiness. That will come, David. You will forget what
I was too weak to prevent.”</p>

<p>I bowed my head, incapable of speech.</p>

<p>“There is only one thing I ask, now,” I said at last.
“Oh, it’s only a little thing, otherwise it would be too
cruel: I ask only to be allowed to see you through the
landing&mdash;just the last courtesies.”</p>

<p>“Yes, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>.”</p>

<p>I held out my hand abruptly, and she gave me both of
hers. She was so close to me that for a moment we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
swayed against each other, parting and longing in our
eyes so poignant that all the world seemed like a whirlpool
drawing us down together.</p>

<p>“Your promise, David, your promise!”</p>

<p>I released her hands instantly and my eyes closed not
to see her so near and so weak. When I knew what I
was doing again, I was alone. How long I had been there,
I do not know. A great mass was before me, thrusting
a torch into the skies and the kindling stars. I went down
the deck like a drunken man and ran into Hungerford,
who came up gayly.</p>

<p>“Hello, there, seen a paper?” He checked himself,
staring at my face. “Here&mdash;Big Dale&mdash;what’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“Wrong&mdash;nothing’s wrong!”</p>

<p>I felt his arm under mine and was glad for this touch
of another human being in my blank loneliness. I heard
him rambling on, nodded my head, and knew not a word
he was saying. This for long minutes, while gradually
I fought back to myself.</p>

<p>To this day I can feel the overwhelming insolence of
the stone weight of New York rising out of the waters,
crushing me down in my utter loneliness. An invisible
hand was lighting up the city; glass squadrons suddenly
relieved, floated in carnival pomp across the night. Across
the vanishing space of bridges, feverish traveling flames
shot out,&mdash;one, two, and then another. A furnace
belched against the sky. Electric signs swarmed out of
the dusk. Below me, over the swift, oily, painted waters,
were green lights, red lights, ferryboats afire, tugs coming
and going, shrieking, puffing, roaring,&mdash;and always we
moved on, irrevocably on, past the Battery, past the
oozing, slimy hulks of the city wharves, rotting below the
fiery splendor of the city’s rise; stagnant as poverty beneath
the soaring pride of wealth, in the miraculous city
of tragic contrasts! How vast it was, how unhuman!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Every note a thousand times multiplied,&mdash;every sensation
of multitude! Multitude on multitude&mdash;armies of
order and disorder&mdash;a collective tyranny that roared
over me on the threshold of America, as the resistless
downward plunge of Niagara beats endlessly. Torrent
of forty nations and twenty creeds, conflict of tongues
and churning of races&mdash;not my America, but the world-vision
of Peter Magnus&mdash;multitudes moving like glaciers
towards destinies no one might confidently predict!</p>

<p>And, against this howling contention, this churning,
grinding background, I saw but one figure,&mdash;the shadow
of a woman, the woman I loved, exiled and alone.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>At six o’clock it was all over. I stood at her carriage
door, bareheaded, bending over her hand. The bustle of
the landing, the examination of the baggage, the damp,
noisy, strident wharf, the pushing and the strife were
behind us,&mdash;too soon gone. Only this remained.</p>

<p>“You can give him your address,” I said, stepping back.</p>

<p>“It is St. Rosa’s Convent.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.” Even at that moment, her trust in me
brought a little comfort.</p>

<p>“Do not worry. I shall be well taken care of.”</p>

<p>“St. Rosa’s Convent,” I said loudly to the driver.</p>

<p>The moment had come. I had not realized what it
would cost me. Before the finality of it, I stood, clutching
the door, incapable of a word.</p>

<p>“God be with you,” she said, bending forward.</p>

<p>“Bernoline&mdash;Bernoline, if ever&mdash;”</p>

<p>She leaned forward and, suddenly remembering, drew
her veil. Our eyes met without wavering, unconscious of
the crowd that jostled and shouted behind us. She raised
her hand and touched my forehead.</p>

<p>“Thank you, from my heart. I shall keep you in my
prayers, day and night&mdash;always, David.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>She sank back, and I saw her face no more. A policeman
shouted an angry order. The carriage moved away.
At the window her hand fluttered in a last weak gesture.
Then, even the window grew blank. I was alone, standing
with head uncovered, in the midst of a group of urchins,
who were mocking my long face.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_III" id="PART_III"></a>PART III</h2>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>I</h3>

<p>The rest is a blur. Clear and definite as is every moment
from my first meeting with Bernoline to the last
faint flutter of her white hand, the rest of the day is
confused. There are hours which are lost, during which
I do not know what I did or where I wandered. The
great city roared about me. I walked interminable miles
along dark, echoing side streets and into sudden flaming
thoroughfares, where rapid crowds descended upon me
like gusts of wind. I can remember the tap-tap of my
cane along some stony solitude, and again standing at
Times Square, in a wilderness of lights, roared at, amid
the clanging and the honking of traffic; crowded, jostled,
buffeted in the polygot stream,&mdash;a stranger in the land
of his fathers.</p>

<p>Those crowds&mdash;those hostile, unintelligible crowds, so
triumphantly successful&mdash;shall I ever forget them! I
had known the monastic multitudes of Paris, slow-moving,
reticent, respectful of the black-garbed mourners, compassionate
and grim, hiding neither their sorrows nor
their sympathy. I had known them and felt at home in
them. But this other thing; this strident influx of
strange tongues, this pagan riot, this shrill pursuit of
pleasure, when all the world was hushed and apprehensive!
What did they understand? What could they be
made to understand? I stood, bewildered&mdash;I who had
come for my American heritage&mdash;more alone, more distant
than when in the long days of convalescence the
dread feeling of homesickness gripped my heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>If this were America, it was the America that Peter
Magnus saw, polygot, cosmopolitan, international, an
America that might be roaring on to some greater world-significance,
but an America that had left me behind.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>My room was on the eighteenth floor of a great hotel
flung above the electric city. Below me swam the theatric
night, the fluid effulgence of Broadway, the piping
thrum of automobiles, the revelry ascending from flaring
restaurants, carried upward into hanging gardens floating
on the night,&mdash;nervous, shifting sheets of electric transparencies,
fantastic, ingenious, unescapable, a million
splendors to exalt a corset or a soap! What a vast,
illuminated billboard! Everything oppressed me, the
staggering scale of things, the importance of unimportant
things, this capture of the night by the materialism of
the day. I watched it, as one stands before the unleashed
torrents of the sea and sky, overwhelmed with my own
shrunk significance.</p>

<p>In the morning my first movement was to my window.
The city of the night was fled. Below me lay a shanty
civilization. The fairy splendor, the figment of the night
had dissolved with the dawn. Broadway was but a huddled
group of puny shanties, with skeleton trickeries exposed
in the pitiless light of the day; ugly, visible,
naked,&mdash;an adventuress stealing home at dawn, rouged,
powdered and wan, and the pretentious jewels of the
night showing themselves to be paste. The whole was
stale as a ballroom when the laughter is fled. The
crowded stars were empty sockets; the flaming palaces,
scaffolding.</p>

<p>Homesickness? Yes, even in Picardy, even in the wet
weariness of the trenches, in the gray rain that soaked
into my soul, I had never felt such utter loneliness as
here, in the nausea of the revealing dawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>I came out of the city and set my face sternly to the
task of readjustment. I would not be true to my determination
to set down without disguise or sentimentalization
the history of my shifting moods, actions and reactions,
emotions and resolves, if I didn’t write this
down. No sooner had I entered the train, pulled my cap
over my eyes and sunk back in my corner, than I fell into
a mood of extreme weakness. As the instinct to live is
stronger in the body, no matter what the will to die, so
I believe that in the thinking man the will to continue
as a free agent is an instinct deeper than our perceptions.
Everything in me rebelled at the sudden subjection which
a blind destiny had forced upon me. Something in me
cried out imperiously:</p>

<p>“Forget! You must forget!”</p>

<p>And this is the hideous thing: the words of the other
woman, the words of Letty, were the ones that sounded
in my ears:</p>

<p>“Life is a succession of doors to be closed and never
reopened.”</p>

<p>To close the door and never to return! If it were
possible!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I said to myself, incredulously, that it was not possible
that in ten days I had come to a final and irrevocable
love; that the romance and the glamor were for much,
that the dramatic quality of the lone woman venturing
into the wilderness of men, the mystery which enveloped
her, had caught my sympathy. I did not attempt, it is
true, to deceive myself into the belief that I did not love
her, but I tried to convince myself that I could and
must forget her.</p>

<p>Yet, even as rebelling against the cruelty of such destiny,
I argued thus, I found myself comparing the women
about me, the women there in the car, the women in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
crowds of New York, the women of the past I had known,
to the Bernoline I loved,&mdash;and wondering where again
in the empty world I would meet with another such. Suddenly,
ahead of me in the far end of the car, a silhouette,
the turn of the neck, a carriage of the head, reminded me
so vividly of her that I sat bolt upright, staring, and so
acute was the sense of her presence that though I knew
it to be the wildest trick of fancy, I could not rest until
I had risen and reassured myself. I returned and sank
back heavily in my corner, no longer with strength or
will to struggle against my fate.</p>

<p>The visible things receded, the unreal present dissolved.
I abandoned myself to the unforgettable past.
I lived again the hours since our meeting. I saw her,
I heard her, I talked with her. I was back on the high
forward deck, with the cliffs of New York growing into
the night. I argued against her decision; I pleaded for
us both. I said the things I should have said, as I reconstructed
the inexorable past, until, struck by my own
absurdity, I regained some measure of self-control.</p>

<p>After all, what remains? What can remain of this, the
purest and deepest seeking of my life? I have dreamed
a beautiful dream! The rest is a waking to the pain of
reality.</p>

<p>Yet is it possible, I wonder, that for this ten days’
dreaming the years of my life must pay the reckoning?</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>II</h3>

<p>At South Norwalk I descended and took the train for
Littledale. Hardly had I turned up the platform before
I was among friends, welcomed with incredulous shouts:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Burke, the conductor, and Lannigan, of the express,
smothering me with rapturous greetings. I rode back in
the baggage car, the center of an admiring group. The
old oil lamps still flickered overhead, undisturbed in their
appointed task of gathering in the cobwebs, and for a
while I forgot my loneliness in the warm pleasure of being
back among my own kind. Heaven be thanked, nothing
had changed! The baggage car still dates from 1870,
wheezing and bumping over the narrow-gauge road as the
old familiar figures gather about the stove in the solemnity
of country-store conclave.</p>

<p>I had not thought to have such a thrill, yet a lump was
in my throat when at the station old man Carpenter came
hobbling up and a group of youngsters set up a cheer.
It was no longer New York: it was my America, and I
belonged to it.</p>

<p>I refused a trap and set out on foot, after cautioning
them against telephoning my arrival. Hardly five years
were gone, yet every detail of the green and white village
was so definite in my memory that I noted with an intolerant
resentment the new porch at Hamill’s and the
glass front which had arrived at Sherwood’s corner grocery.
All my boyhood was about me as I hurried on
under the vaulted elms: Parson Miller’s home, where Ben
and I had strung a tick-tack; the green picket fence
where the fox terrier came fearfully out when we rattled
our sticks; the side street where I had fought M’Ginnis;
the hideous soldiers’ monument, where the snowball fights
raged; the stone bridge to which I used to steal after
supper to meet Jenny. The past lay at my side,&mdash;tranquil,
unchanging, and undisturbed by the currents that
whirled and struggled three thousand miles away, and
in that moment I, too, felt a leaping joy in my heart to
be in this America which had stood still in the breathless
rush of things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>The lights were in the windows of the great hall as I
turned the postern and came up the deep well of the
evergreens, towards the low, rambling, red house that sat
at the feet of the three drooping elms. I came slowly
across the white hoar frost which coated the lawn, and
the stiff gravel crackled as I stood under the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porte-cochère</i>,
undecided, fearful of what I should find, steeling
myself against the shock of disillusionment, and in my
heart the cold repugnance of that one dreaded confrontation,&mdash;Letty,
at the side of Ben. Yet, despite doubt
and shrinking, I think that in my heart the deepest sentiment
was a weak gladness to leave all the world behind
and come back, as a tired boy comes back, into that sheltered
warmth which is called home.</p>

<p>As I debated, with a sudden scurry and barking defiance,
the dogs came tumbling over each other,&mdash;and
the next moment old Dan was in my arms, while the two
younger dogs, accepting me on faith, set up a furious
chatter. Then, a rush of feet across the hall, the door
flung open, and something soft and fluttering leaped to
my neck;&mdash;home was a reality and Molly was crying my
name! It was no longer the laughing tomboy of the
bobbed hair and short skirts, but a woman whose eyes
were on a level with mine. I took her by the shoulders
and held her from me fiercely, and then caught her to me
once more with a great thankfulness, for the eyes were
straight and clear and the heart was the heart of my
little sister.</p>

<p>My mother ran out, and it gave me a great thrill to
see her face, for we had always stood in awe of her,&mdash;of
her austerity, her brilliance and her measured mentality.
To us she had always been one on whose public
services we children should never intrude. I think she
must have pictured me as stricken or mutilated, for I
shall never forget the first incredulous look on her face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
as she saw me, and then&mdash;the burst of tears. In all my
life, in stress and disaster, I never remember to have seen
her show such emotion.</p>

<p>“Be careful, with the Governor,” Molly whispered.
“Don’t seem surprised. He’s in there.”</p>

<p>He was in the dusky library, sunk in a great leather
chair, a drop-light at his side, and I noticed at once how
thin and loose was the hand that lay on the magazine.</p>

<p>“Hello, Governor,” I said. “Dropped in to see you.”</p>

<p>He put out his hand and felt of me. He was gray, and
the red blood had run from his face and left feeble
veins under the drawn skin. The watery eyes came unsteadily
up to mine and passed on to the faces of my
mother and Molly, in a silent, terrifying interrogation.
I guessed what was in his mind, even before he <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Then, it’s closer than I thought.”</p>

<p>The mater stood it without flinching, but Molly
swayed and went suddenly out of the room.</p>

<p>“Not much, Governor,” I said, in bluff cheerfulness.
“We’re a tough lot. They tried hard to get me, but they
couldn’t. Don’t get any such nonsense in your head. I
came home because the doctors insisted upon my being
fattened up before they’d let me back. Two months’
furlough.”</p>

<p>His fingers had closed over my wrist and, still holding
it, he motioned me to be seated.</p>

<p>“Glad you’re here, Davy.”</p>

<p>“And lots to tell you, Governor. I’ve good news for
you.”</p>

<p>“Alan?”</p>

<p>Now, the Governor had never been as quick as that,
and I ascribe it to the uncanny prescience which comes
to the very sick.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;Alan.” I drew out the cross from my pocket
and laid it before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>“Governor, you don’t need to be ashamed of Alan.
He sent that to you, and told me to tell you how he’d
won it.”</p>

<p>He looked up quickly at the mater, and his lip trembled
so that we hurriedly changed the subject. I left him
presently, with a promise to return, and went out into
the hall, where Molly’s hand slid into mine.</p>

<p>“Aunt Janie?”</p>

<p>“Upstairs.”</p>

<p>“You expected me?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Brinsmade telephoned.”</p>

<p>“Who’s here?” I said suddenly. “Ben?”</p>

<p>“No. They’re coming at the end of the week.”</p>

<p>This news took a sudden dread from my heart. For
that night, the night of my home-coming, I would not
have to face that!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The very old change little. Aunt Janie was the same
fairy godmother that I remember as a mischievous youngster:
tall, thin, a little stooped, soft-voiced, gentle, living
in a more measured age, aloof from the momentum of
the present. Strange, silent, devoted soul: she had come
into the home, asking of life only the opportunity of
serving others! She had brought us up, run the house,
planted the trees which had grown to stature and let
the rest of the world pass her by, faithful to the one and
only love of her life, the memory of the Captain of the
&mdash;th Massachusetts who had died at Antietam. His
sword hangs above the fireplace and his portrait is in
the locket at her throat. Each night, after the rest of
the house has retired, she descends and closes the doors,
examines the windows, ushers the dogs into the back hall,
and extinguishes the lights. Nothing has ever been able
to dissuade her from this last responsibility. We argued
with her, we implored her, and, finally, we came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
accept with a feeling of restful gratitude the sound of her
slippered step up the stairs, ushering in the night.</p>

<p>I am always to her about twelve years old and, I think,
her favorite.</p>

<p>“I have prayed for you every night, Davy,” she said,
when I put my arm around her. “<i>You’ve</i> come back.”</p>

<p>Possibly she had been dreaming by the fire of the
other, who had not returned. I sat there, trying to
answer her questions and finding it difficult. It is not
easy to talk about the war. The point of view is so
different. All that I have lived has been so inevitable,
so part of the instincts of the man who fights, that I find
it hard to comprehend the curiosity of those who look on
it from the outside. To me still it is this other life that
is incomprehensible and chaotic, and profoundly disturbing.
When men must fight, it is better to forget.&mdash;With
all the home memories thronging about me, sitting
there with Aunt Janie’s hand in mine, I was thinking but
one thing.</p>

<p>“In two months I shall return to it&mdash;the grim gamble&mdash;where
those who stake their lives must lose in the
end inevitably,&mdash;as all gamblers do.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>III</h3>

<p>The next night Molly and I drove over to the Brinsmades’.
Anne had been insistently in my thoughts all
day. All my revolt from the dead weight of emptiness
in life was instinctively towards her. Yet I can hardly
explain to myself now the strangeness of my conduct,
once in her presence, nor the motive that prompted me
deliberately to wound her, as though I were seeking
once for all to reject her from my life. Was it some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
savage instinct of honesty towards her, or a strange unhuman
bitterness that entered my soul,&mdash;a resentment
for the thing offered against the thing denied? I do not
know. I cannot yet see clearly.</p>

<p>Yet I do know that I came there eagerly, with a great
need of the affection of my old playmate. For what
Bernoline had waked in me, the discovery of the harmonious
companionship of a true woman, had left me
with a new feeling of dependence. Perhaps, also, in the
years of absence, I had idealized my very human little
friend.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I do not know if such contradictory impulses are true
to others or only to me. I imagine that few persons
would understand me. Yet it is true that in the desolate
loneliness against which I was struggling, I longed to
find in some one, some one known and kind, some measure
of that deep womanhood of the Bernoline who had gone.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>When we arrived the dance was in full swing. I stood
staring, unable to adjust myself to the carnival note.
For months I had not looked on such a scene. For
months I had forgotten the existence of this world, where
color fired the imagination and music awoke disturbing
needs of pleasure. Anne hurried forward, we shook
hands, and&mdash;a sudden shyness came between us. Others
crowded up, an old friend or two, chance acquaintances;
an indiscriminate, curious crowd that, to my annoyance,
insisted on treating me as a hero. I resented it all. The
men offended me. I forgot I had once been like them.
How unrelated to actualities they were, these men, mostly
of my generation, of the generation of wasted opportunities,
well-set-up, pleasing, clean-cut, but so untested, so
devoid of the stamp of leadership. What could they know
of the realities that were gathering on the horizon? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
sobered France of Bernoline lay outside. Light and
shadow, I thought. Half the world dancing, while the
other half staggers through the night!</p>

<p>Then I thought of the leaping call to duty which, in
the coming day, would startle them in the midst of their
playtime. And, knowing what I know, the irony of it
all stood out. How little they could divine the future or
what the immutable, slow-moving course of little things
could mean to each.</p>

<p>“My generation is the tragic generation,” De Saint
Omer had often said to me. Would this, too, be our
tragic generation,&mdash;a generation brought up only to play,
to enjoy life gluttonously, to pursue pleasure riotously&mdash;abruptly
halted in the full of the revelry and summoned
to face the recurring test of the ages?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I dare say the mood was morbid and my own mental
condition was accountable for much in it. Yet there was
cause for irritation. My ears were filled with the chatter
of silliness. I was paraded for the curiosity of empty-headed
girls, outrageously décolleté and bejeweled. Had
I been afraid? Wouldn’t I please tell them about the
atrocities? Had I really killed a man? What did it
feel like? What sort of uniform did I wear? Was it
attractive?</p>

<p>One disappointed young lady exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Then you’re not an aviator. I’m just
crazy to have one of those dinky little caps!”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Molly, who divined my irritation, saved the situation
by drawing me away into the library, where I shook hands
with Mr. Brinsmade, and presently, ashamed of my too
evident ill-humor, I returned to the ballroom.</p>

<p>I was a little hurt, too, that Anne had not made more
of my coming. I remembered her diffidence, her quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
yielding to others who pressed around her, and I asked
myself moodily the reason for this attitude. Was it the
memory of old days, of certain things half expressed in
her letters? Had her father spoken to her as he had to
me? Did she expect that I would assume any rights
over her? This last thought increased my irritation. I
stood at the door of the conservatory, watching her as she
danced.</p>

<p>It was not the Anne that I remembered. There was a
finished charm about all she did, a grace of conscious
assurance, a sure sense of her own value, that for some
reason offended me. She was no longer an impulsive girl,
but a brilliant and confident woman. From the tumult
of her golden hair to the decolleté of her black jet gown,
that revealed too boldly the lithe and graceful lines of
her body; in the ready smile of attention, to the eyes
which had the fevered sense of pleasure, she was one of
them,&mdash;of a vapid, inconsequential society which, that
night, offended every instinct in me.</p>

<p>“And the worst is, she feeds upon it,” I said to myself
gloomily.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>When the dance ended, she came directly to me, smiling
and confident. I was quite at a loss to account for the
sudden antagonism which came over me.</p>

<p>“I’ve saved this dance: it’s yours, Davy. If you’ll
ask me?”</p>

<p>“I’ve forgotten how,” I said shortly, and with very bad
grace. “Besides, after all this while, we might have
something to say to each other.”</p>

<p>Now, this was not only ill-humored, but unjustified.
She looked at me quickly and then, with a glance down
the conservatory: “There’s a corner. Let’s sit it out,
then?”</p>

<p>A little remorseful, I gave her my arm, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>“First I want to thank you for your letters. They
meant a lot.”</p>

<p>She did not answer, suddenly serious, wondering, perhaps,
at my mood. When we had come to our corner
she turned and faced me.</p>

<p>“You have changed, Davy.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t think I should have known you.” She
looked at me so quickly that I added, “You see&mdash;I am
dazzled.”</p>

<p>“You do not approve?”</p>

<p>The truth is that I did not quite approve, and her question
threw me off my guard. She must have read in my
eyes, for such a hurt look came to the corners of her lips
that I repeated hastily:</p>

<p>“My dear Anne, I am dazzled. Just think; I have
come out of a gray world, and I am still blinking with
astonishment. I can’t quite get used to it. You women
are different from the women over there&mdash;more feminine,
perhaps&mdash;but you represent something I had forgotten.
Don’t pay any attention to me. I’m an old bear who
comes to you, grumbling, out of the wet and the mud.”</p>

<p>“I see,” she said, and then, “but I do pay attention to
what you say, so please be frank, as you always were,
Davy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you would understand,” I began and
then, struck by the absurdity of it, I broke into a laugh.
“After all, it isn’t the slightest business of mine.”</p>

<p>“Am I any different from the rest?”</p>

<p>I looked into the dancing crowd.</p>

<p>“No, of course not.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;then?”</p>

<p>“Anne, you will not understand in the least; you
probably will be offended, but, since you ask, I will tell
you.”</p>

<p>But there I stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p>“So, you’re not going to tell me?”</p>

<p>“No. Besides, it is a question of a point of view.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what you really think of me, Davy?” she
said, puzzled. “Is it such a very bad opinion?”</p>

<p>“It is not your fault. It is the whole system,” I blurted
out, led on by my growing irritation; the feeling, perhaps,
of the quality of girlhood that should be there and was
now gone; the eyes that had seen too much, the ears
that had heard too much, the woman who knew too well
her worth in the eyes of men. Perhaps it was because I
needed to see her differently that I felt so strongly.
“It’s you who are defrauded. There are bigger things in
our women than just the pursuit of pleasure. However,”
I broke off, with a sudden laugh, “I am just as absurd to
be talking to you like this!”</p>

<p>“I wanted to go over there and nurse,” she said, looking
down. “Heavens, don’t you think I’m tired of this sort
of life!”</p>

<p>“I wonder just how sincere that is,” I said, watching
her with amusement. “Service, or&mdash;adventure?”</p>

<p>She sat up, suddenly frowning.</p>

<p>“You will go back?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a recollection smote me.</p>

<p>“My dear Anne, don’t mind me to-night. I dare say
I’m unjust, but I’m living in another world, and this
shocks me&mdash;the incomprehension of it all! Are these
really men and women, and do they think war is a vaudeville
show? Yes, I am out of temper; but if you’d heard
the questions I’ve been asked! I beg your pardon. You
were very good to write me all the time: it meant a lot,
too.”</p>

<p>She looked up, so happily, that I began to reproach
myself for my boorishness.</p>

<p>“What is it you don’t like in me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>“I should like to see you&mdash;you and Molly&mdash;in the
blue and white of the Red Cross, with big square hob-nailed
boots, splashing around in the mud and rain, with
smirches on your dainty noses!”</p>

<p>I had hurt her, despite my assumed levity, and I knew
it. Some one came up to claim a dance, and she rose
quickly, both of us glad of the interruption. The rest
of the evening I spent with Mr. Brinsmade, discussing
politics. Now that I write it, I am sorry that I acted as
I did. Yet I am at a loss to know why.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>IV</h3>

<p>I have seen Letty. I had steeled myself against the
meeting, with a cold, panicky dread. Yet, when the actual
test came, I was amazed at my self-possession. The
inevitable thing is, after all, the easiest thing to do. It
was so, I remember, with my first test in battle, the question
of courage, which had so tortured my imagination,
clarified itself with the first command. I answered it,
as others did, because, I think, there was no choice.</p>

<p>So, the moment that the crisis arose, I knew it would
have to be gone through,&mdash;that I would have to meet
her eyes and his without a false movement. It had to
be done, and I did it, as calmly and as naturally as though
I had lied all my life. And yet, there was one awful moment
for me,&mdash;and for her, too.</p>

<p>They had motored over for luncheon and I knew that
they would arrive about one o’clock. I debated and made
a dozen decisions, changing them immediately. I would
wait until all the company was assembled and meet
them in the confusion of the crowd. I even contemplated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
a morning canter, timing my ride so as to
meet them on my return, and obtain some clue of the
exact situation in the advantage of the hasty informality.
For I felt a cold dread of the test. What had she told
him? Was I to act as a chance acquaintance, or as an
old friend? If I pretended ignorance, my attitude might
rouse his suspicions immediately. Yet if I called her by
her first name and showed the knowledge of an intimate,
I might precipitate a dangerous situation. I must take
my cue from her, holding myself alertly on my guard.</p>

<p>At the last moment, at the sound of their entering the
driveway, I did the thing I had not even considered. I
went out on the porch and stood forth openly to greet
them, curiously calm and ready for any turn, now that
it was a question of danger. Yet I loathed the dissimulation
I could not escape. The next instants seemed
leaden. The car drove up. I looked at Ben, steadily,
controlling my glance. Fortunately, he was nearest to
me.</p>

<p>“Hello, there, old fellow!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Ben,” I said, in my heart a great thankfulness.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bon jour, Monsieur</i>, my brother-in-law; you have not
forgotten me?”</p>

<p>I looked. I had to look. Letty’s shadowy eyes&mdash;calm,
even a trifle amused&mdash;were on me, and no more
trace of emotion than was in her voice.</p>

<p>“The idea! But I did not expect to meet you again
like this,” I heard myself saying, with all the banality of
an accomplished society fop. Had there been a look of
fear or distress in her eyes I might have faltered, but the
self-possession roused my anger and that carried me
through. I took the gloved hand (thank heaven it was
gloved) and forced some sort of a smile to my face.
Fortunately the others ran out, and the first test was
over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>Luncheon ended, after coffee in the conservatory, Ben
said:</p>

<p>“Davy, let’s take a tramp around the duck pond.
There are some things I want to talk over with you.”</p>

<p>I rose and I know that my heart leaped. I saw Letty’s
little fingers work slowly up the arms of her chair and
her shoulders stiffen. That was all; but I, who knew
Letty, knew what terror was beneath.</p>

<p>We bundled up and went out over the hard ground,
and, as we turned the conservatory, I saw that Letty had
taken up a position by the window. I did not dare look
at her, for my own heart within me stood still, while I
waited his first words. Everything required me to make
some reference to his wife, and yet I could not do it.
My tongue refused to move.</p>

<p>“The mater does not like my marriage, Davy,” he said
finally, after he had waited for me to begin the conversation.
“Oh, it’s nothing open; she’s too loyal for
that, you know; but of course, their worlds are absolutely
different. Still, I feel it, and I know that Letty
feels it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose that would be so,” I said, forced to
answer.</p>

<p>Again, he seemed to wait for something I should say
and when I remained silent, he dropped into a silence,
too. Presently, he began to whistle to himself, and so
we came to the duck pond. The cabin we had built as
children still stood, sagging and covered with moss.</p>

<p>“I can’t get Rossie out of my mind,” I said suddenly.
“Remember the day he stepped into the hornet’s nest and
had to dive into the pond?”</p>

<p>We stood on the rustic bridge, leaning over the rail,
the white, solemn ducks waddling below us.</p>

<p>“Davy, will you answer me a direct question?”</p>

<p>I felt the moment approaching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>“Fire away.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever write back anything against Letty to
the family?”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>He repeated the question, while for me the tension relaxed.
Still, this might be only a preliminary.</p>

<p>“Ben, I have never written a word home mentioning
your wife one way or the other.”</p>

<p>“You knew her well in Paris, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“We were in the same crowd, yes.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you a little bit in love with her at one time?”</p>

<p>“Frankly, yes; we all were.”</p>

<p>I had given my answers readily, for each question I
had foreseen.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Davy,” he said, looking me in the face,
“that I am beginning to think that you, too, do not approve.”</p>

<p>“That’s a hard question to answer, but since you’ve
put it,&mdash;here goes. There’s been something closer between
us, Ben, than other brothers. I think I would
make any sacrifice for you and your happiness. I’m not
thinking of Letty; I’m thinking of you. I know her
world and I know yours. Her world is a world that takes
everything lightly and is not bruised by disillusionments.
You are different. If you should be unhappy, it would
break you.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know her as I know her,” he broke in.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;of course not.” For a moment the hideous
irony of it escaped me. Had it been any other man, I
would have been willing to convince myself that Letty,
like a thousand other women of her class, was capable,
once her love awakened, of absolute loyalty and devotion.
But did she really love him, beyond a caprice of the emotions?
That was what I did not know.</p>

<p>“Ben, you know that I am always loyal, no matter what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
happens. If it were a question of your good, old fellow,
I would give my right arm.”</p>

<p>I held out my hand, and waited. If he could not bring
himself to take it&mdash;but he did&mdash;though after some
hesitation! The first test, thank God, was over. He
could not have suspected and done that!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>What had we said to each other? What could I have
said differently? I was caught in the iron grip of circumstance,
and every word was dictated to me. I knew
my brother, and I was afraid,&mdash;coldly, mortally afraid.
Such men are capable of murder.</p>

<p>Then I told him of Bernoline. Some instinct warned
me to do so, and the way his face cleared and the old
affection returned confirmed my suspicions. Beneath all
he had said (or not said) was something brooding. Only,
in that case, the situation was more than ever fraught
with danger.</p>

<p>We went back over the old days, when we four were
the Littledale boys,&mdash;Big Dale, Little Dale, Tiny Dale,
and Rossie, who was no Dale at all. With the clearing
vista of years, I saw my brother as he was, and I was
astonished to find in my new estimate a sense of personal
superiority. He felt it, too, for once or twice he
said something which showed me that he had a feeling
of having stood still.</p>

<p>I told him of having seen Alan.</p>

<p>“I never liked him,” he said, without compromise, “and
there’s no use pretending; but I’m glad he made good.”
He turned to me, laying his hand on my arm for the first
time. “Davy, there’s not been much luck in the family,
has there? We’re out of existence&mdash;shot to pieces.
And the other time doesn’t seem so very far ago,&mdash;the
time when we romped and played like good, wholesome
puppies. Rossie gone&mdash;Alan drifting about the world&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
crawling back by the skin of your teeth&mdash;I suppose
there’s no use arguing with you about your going
back?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we don’t wake up and get into it, I’m going,
myself,” he blurted out. “The mater, of course, is all
for pacifism, but as for the Governor, I believe he’s
just hanging on until we declare war.”</p>

<p>“I believe so, too.”</p>

<p>“Must seem strange to you, here.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;strange.”</p>

<p>We each wished the interview over, I felt. With all
our attempts at restoring the old intimacy, there was a
constraint on us we couldn’t shake off.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The first thing I saw, as we went back, was Letty’s
face at the window of the conservatory. It was only a
look, for she rose immediately and shifted her seat, but
that look I shall never efface from my memory. She was
no coward. Indeed, I have never known any woman
with more of the reckless, devil-may-care attitude towards
danger, but that vital hour, when she sat there and wondered,
must have tried her soul.</p>

<p>When we entered she was consummately at ease.
She did not appear to notice our coming, but once I
caught her glancing furtively in the mirror, watching
Ben.</p>

<p>I went on upstairs and there, in the old playroom, the
tension I had been under snapped and my nerves went
bad and, as I was doubled up, shivering and shaking,
Molly found me. It must have frightened her out of her
wits, to come upon me without warning, for by the time
the spell was over, she was in my arms, weeping her heart
out.</p>

<p>“Oh, Davy, you aren’t going back, like that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<p>“Nonsense! It’s almost over&mdash;only, once in a while&mdash;when
something excites me.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been talking to Ben,” she said, straightening
up. “Davy, I don’t <i>like</i> her! And, what’s more, Ben
isn’t happy!”</p>

<p>What could I say? I couldn’t look into my dear little
sister’s clean eyes and counsel her to accept Letty with
an open heart.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I went back presently and joined the company. I knew
that in public I must pay my brother’s wife some attention.
To avoid her would be confession. She had quite
recovered by this time and was her own malicious self
again.</p>

<p>“Do you know, David, that you have neglected me
shamefully?” she said aloud. “You were more gallant
in Paris.”</p>

<p>I made some lame excuse. I do not remember what I
muttered and, avoiding any intimacy, turned the conversation
to common acquaintances. I cannot remember a
more hideously disagreeable hour in all my life. Not
that there was left any flicker of the old infatuation. The
image of Bernoline had cleansed the old fever. I looked
at Letty and, looking at her, wondered that I could meet
her eyes without a tremor. She felt this, I know, and
did not like the sensation for, despite the danger of the
situation, her voice at times took on the old caressing
tone and her eyes sparkled with the desire to entice. Our
conversation was necessarily banal in the presence of
others. It was not until they started to go that I found
myself alone with her on the porch.</p>

<p>“I hope to God you did it because you love him,” I
said, without premeditation.</p>

<p>“And if there was any other reason, Davy?” she said
softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>“He is quite capable of killing you. I give you a solemn
warning.”</p>

<p>Her fur slipped to the ground and, as I recovered it,
she said aloud:</p>

<p>“Thank you, my brother-in-law&mdash;and you will be
sociable, and run over?”</p>

<p>Ben had come up as we were speaking, but her quick
ear had detected his approach.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The interview has left me quite in the dark. Why had
she done it? Is she in love with Ben? Is there any
change in the inner woman? Can she be held wholly and
loyally by a man with whom she cannot trifle, before
whom she is genuinely afraid? Was it the dramatic revenge
that tempted her? Or was it just the instinct of
social self-preservation, the fetich of that great god, Respectability,
which dominates all such women? For, protest
as they may, no matter how they rage against conventionalities,
flout them openly or secretly, in the heart
of each lawless woman, whether her situation be sheltered
or ruthlessly exposed, is the slumbering veneration
of the thing called respectability. Once passed the thirties,
it becomes an obsession. Perhaps, after all, it was
the safe haven of respectability that Letty sought, at the
end of a few adventurous years. Perhaps, it was a combination
of all these motives. But, of one thing I am
certain,&mdash;Letty is afraid of her husband.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>December</i></p>

<p>My first Sunday has come and gone. All day I have
been looking at myself and at my home with a new revelation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
of values. Strangely enough, I never before perceived
its significance. France and another civilization
have suddenly thrown it into a clearer relief, and all the
while the words of Bernoline return to my memory. What
a contrast!</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock we departed to Sunday worship: Ben
and my mother to the Unitarian Church; Aunt Janie to
the Congregational, with father; and Molly and myself
to a Presbyterian service, accompanied by the servants.
No scene is more typical of what we are: a group of individualists
bound together by mutual tolerance. Are
we a home, I wonder, or simply a shelter over a group of
lodgers for this night or for many nights? Of course,
it is not fair to take us as typical of America. Yet we
are typical of one thing,&mdash;a developed type of traditional
New England. This morning, as I sat in the old pew,
with Molly by my side, I thought with a little tightening
of my heart that even in the coming days of suspense
when I go back to the front my family will not be even
united in its sorrow.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The whole contrast between our two civilizations,
French and American, is here,&mdash;in the family. Thinking
on this to-night, I understand Bernoline better. The
sense of duty that dominates her life and makes sacrifice
so easily possible is the sense of family solidarity. Love
of the mother, respect for the authority of the father,
companionship with the children,&mdash;it is a France in miniature,
and that greater love of country is but a tradition
of family pride.</p>

<p>I do not think we have this strongly disciplined sense
of duty nor this unquestioning acceptance of sacrifice.
How often children are but accidents and sometimes
strangers under the same roof. In my own case, what
is my father to me? Do I know him as well as I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
the boy I roomed with at school, I wonder? There is
hardly an opinion we share or an outlook on life which
we could understand together. He has never really discussed
anything with me, as though instinctively he
divined I would take an opposite view.</p>

<p>I don’t say what should be. Yet to-night, perhaps
because the sense of loss of a dear and necessary presence
accents my own loneliness, I can visualize another type
of home&mdash;the home of Bernoline&mdash;and wonder....
After all, there is something that touches the heart
strings in the thought of the generations succeeding each
other, standing for the same ideal of conduct, the same
loyalty to a conception of state and faith, passing down
the same standard from father and son and guarding it in
reverence! Governments change as I change my hat;
waves of paganism, materialism and doubt come and
pass; but so long as the family faith is untouched, France
will be found equal to its past. Order, stability, discipline,&mdash;the
sunken cornerstone of the national consciousness
are all in this conception, and I think to understand this
is to understand why there was no miracle in France’s
answer in the month of August, 1914.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Yet, I have no doubt now of America’s answer when the
call is clear: only we will respond from different motives.
If the sense of duty is not developed here by old traditions,
there is a man’s pride in doing what free men
should do. It will be a great voluntary impulse, something
that has come down to us from our strong, free, battling
ancestors of Jutland, of those who sang of heroic
deaths and defied the tempest and the perils of the forest,
who never bowed to king or conqueror,&mdash;the fierce dissenting
strain of Saxon manhood. I am not afraid of
this heritage when stirred by the test of war;&mdash;but in
peace?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p>What is the basic impulse, then, that moves through
our Anglo-Saxon civilization? It is the relation between
man and woman, and this conception of love as heroic
is of the origins of our race. Christianity did not exalt
women with us. In the days of the Berserkers and the
sea-rovers, man and woman clove together in single
partnership and kept their faith. So, to-day, the children
in the house are but waiting the touch of destiny,
free agents, held by no family tradition, impatient for
life to open to them. Under all the sentimentalism of
our literature and art there is this abiding instinct, the
need of love that shall come as a directing purpose. Each
child, in the imagination of boy or girl, holds it as his
right to give his heart where it pleases him, no matter
what the wrench or what the sacrifice, as the beginning
and the meaning of life. In this instinct to determine
our own existence as children in our father’s house, we
remain fierce and rebellious, as our Saxon heroes who
served, but feared neither their gods nor their masters.
We do not inherit our homes: we create them.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>My little sister, who hangs on my arm and comes to
me with her confidences, knows deep in her heart that
this is not her home. To-morrow she will look in the
eyes of some stranger and, despite all our entreaties,
pleadings, warnings, put her hand in his and follow him
into the outer world. No wonder that we have colonized
the earth, when each of us has in him the soul of the
pioneer! And now that I have written this, I think I
understand why I cannot do what would be so easy for
a Latin to do. Marriage to us is not a formula, but a
need of our hidden spiritual self, the meaning of
our existence. No, I can never turn to Anne with a
divided memory, not even in the instinct of self-preservation!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<p>Everything separates me from Bernoline. In our basic
conceptions of life, she in her clear outlook of faith, and
I in my driven questionings; she in her unquestioned
acceptance of duty; I in my rebellion against aught which
means the immolation of self on the altar of convention.
We are as distant as though she stood at the threshold
of a hundred years and I at the close. A civilization
and an age intervene between us. Yet why, knowing this,
despite instinct and will, have we been powerless to turn
away? Is it, I wonder, because the thing is so utterly
hopeless, forbidden, destructive, that the instinct of Eden
draws us irresistibly to our destiny?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Yesterday I read in Maeterlinck’s “Life of The Bee”
that strange and terrible chapter of the Nuptial Flight,
which in its fearful mystery of love and death reveals
to us the mysterious origin in nature’s purpose of our
human seeking. How little we foresee in the first quickening
ecstasy of our beings the destiny of tragedy towards
which we move! How little, in that one clear, untroubled
afternoon, when all the beating frenzy in me grew still
and peaceful with the knowledge that I was loved, did I
divine that the rapture which held me was but the prelude
to life denied and the ache of happiness remembered.
Mystery of good and evil! How often this thought
returns across the vista of my life!</p>

<p>The thing I cannot struggle against is silence,&mdash;this
blank wall of silence that I cannot seize and yet which
fastens about me and shuts out all hope. If I could but
see her, talk to her, write to her! But between that and
nothingness is my promise. Yesterday, in my loneliness
and rebellion, I wrote her,&mdash;a wild, incoherent letter,
imploring her to release me of a promise beyond my
strength to keep. I sealed it and addressed it, refusing
to listen to anything but the fever and the revolt that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
burned through every fiber of my being. I rushed out of
the house and down to the village, with only one thought,&mdash;to
end the suspense, to be done with my conscience
by an irrevocable act. And then I came back, slowly,
with lagging steps, beaten, the letter destroyed. Why?
Because, in all the checkered path of my life, there is one
memory inviolate. No matter what I have done, and
bitterly regretted; no matter what I may come to in some
middle-aged sophistry,&mdash;I once have reached an ideal
of myself. This ideal that she, Bernoline, created of me
can never be lowered. Whatever in its tyranny this
memory demands of me, I shall in the end obey.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>VI</h3>

<p>I remember an incident in my boyhood. A little Airedale
called Frazzles had become so wild that a conference
of the powers had decided on sending her away to
a veterinary. The sentence was duly carried out, and
Frazzles was deported in the last days of autumn, while
we children howled our grief in the nursery. The
next we heard of her, she had escaped and taken to the
woods some twenty miles away, where she was living like
a wild animal. The winter passed and then the spring,
and one day Frazzles came, scratching at the door, weary,
savage, and caked with mud. The door opened, she flew
to her old post under the blue sofa by the fireplace. Six
months had passed,&mdash;outcast from home and humanity,
yet, at the hour when the tea-cakes were brought in, she
crept out of her hiding; place and lay at the feet of Aunt
Janie, just as though it were yesterday.</p>

<p>At times I feel strangely akin to that little bedraggled
outcast. I have fallen back so easily into the familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
routine that all the other life seems incredible. Have I
ever really lived in the wet and slime of the trenches,
pillowed on a foul blanket; and is it possible that in a
few short weeks the moving finger of fate will return and
touch me over again? It is so far off, so obscure, fainter
than a dying echo; only the memory of Bernoline is vivid
and acute with the power to pain.</p>

<p>Against this memory I struggle day and night. There
are times when I combat it fiercely in the instinct of self-preservation,
when I try to reach down into my heart and
tear out the thing that aches. At others, I yield to a
fool’s paradise and delude myself with impossible solutions
that deceive me but for an hour.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Yesterday, in my desperation, I went over to the Brinsmades’.
I went, deliberately, to see Anne. Why, I do
not know. For Anne, I think, loves me, and, despite all
my reason, all my will to escape from my destiny, I do
not, I cannot love her as she deserves to be loved. Perhaps,
if I had not met <span class="locked">Bernoline&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I went, hesitating and undecided. I came away convinced.
Whatever comes, I care this much for my boy-hood’s
companion; I shall never come to her with a
memory between us.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was a morning when Bernoline’s presence had been
so acutely near me that there was no escape from the
blank impossibility of the future. Did I go to seek
some strange, healing comfort in the knowledge of
another’s suffering,&mdash;even as I suffered without possibility
of hope? The instinct of love is, I suppose, so
fiercely primitive in us that under its tyranny we are
subjected to some moral atavism. All the primitive passions
that have swayed us from the dawn of time are suddenly
let loose and, with the leaping impulse towards
possession, comes the instinct to hate violently or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
desire fiercely the joy that comes from the feeling of
being able to cause pain, to turn against another all
that we suffer from the one we love. Girl or courtesan,
I have seen women pour out treasures of sacrifice to one
man and at the same time show themselves savagely, incomprehensibly
pitiless to an unwelcome lover.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Not that all this was in my thought. Far from it. I
went, brooding and restless, without impulse but to
escape from myself. I drove over after luncheon, after
telephoning my coming.</p>

<p>She came down immediately and at my first look I
felt a guilty feeling, yet one of some compensating happiness.</p>

<p>“There’s a house party, but I got rid of them,” she
said, giving me both her hands. “Do you know, Davy,
you have waited a long, long time to come.”</p>

<p>“I have wanted to, many times.”</p>

<p>“Really, and honestly?” she said, looking me in the
eyes.</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>My heart smote me as I met her glance. One word
from me had brought back the comrade of other days.
From her hair to the stout walking boots, all artifice had
been so evidently offered up on the altar of my criticism
that I could not help saying:</p>

<p>“Now I remember an old friend.”</p>

<p>She laughed at this and her eyes sparkled, but there
was a retort on her tongue.</p>

<p>“It’s quite hopeless to try and please you,&mdash;and I
who fondly believed I was going to make such an impression
on you with my grand manner!”</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Flattery, you don’t take me in like that.
There were others present, and&mdash;you didn’t know I
was coming.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>“Father told me,” she said abruptly. “Let’s get out
of this hothouse atmosphere. How about a ramble into
the glen? There’s not enough snow to bother us. Shall
we?”</p>

<p>“Agreed.”</p>

<p>Well bundled up, we struck out over the frozen swamps
for the solitudes of the hills, and as we went a curious
diffidence fell between us.</p>

<p>“David, it’s you who are the stranger,” she said suddenly.
“You are changed, much changed.”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“Your eyes are terribly critical of things you don’t
like. You&mdash;you rather intimidate me. Please be a
little kind in your judgments.”</p>

<p>“I am not aware&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have changed. Before, I often wondered how
you would turn out&mdash;you might have gone so many ways.
You have been tested and you have found yourself. Only,
Davy, in finding yourself, I think you have forgotten a
little the way you have gone and are apt to be without
much indulgence towards others.”</p>

<p>Now, the directness of this analysis and its point quite
startled me.</p>

<p>“Do you think I am like that?” I said, wondering.</p>

<p>She nodded decisively, twice.</p>

<p>“And dreadfully direct. You can’t conceal what you
feel.”</p>

<p>A memory returned, and, also, a possible explanation.</p>

<p>“What I said that first night hurt you?”</p>

<p>“Terribly.”</p>

<p>“You attach too much importance to a chance remark.”</p>

<p>“Don’t.”</p>

<p>I stopped short in my lumbering explanation.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me like that,” she said, looking at me
with a little frown above her eyes. “Davy, in the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
days there was nothing but absolute honesty between
us&mdash;no nonsense. I have known many men since you
went; naturally, some who attracted me,&mdash;one or two,
very much&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” I said, but, to my surprise, with a certain
instinctive resentment.</p>

<p>“But no one else to whom I could talk, frankly and
openly, as I always did with you. Don’t change that,
because”&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;“because, Davy, you can
help me to see clearer in many ways, and&mdash;and I shall
always be to you the one person to whom you can tell
anything. Davy, memories, the real memories, I think,
are the things to hold on to in this world.”</p>

<p>Her words went through me like a knife, so near were
they to my own fate. It was all that I could do to
fight back the telltale moodiness I felt rising in my face,
for I knew her eyes were on me.</p>

<p>“I really need to talk to you, Davy,” she said, when I
did not answer, and there was such a plaintive note in her
voice that, to cover my unease, I held out my hand and
said with an appearance of bluffness:</p>

<p>“All right: the old alliance is renewed.”</p>

<p>“Absolute honesty?”</p>

<p>“So help me.”</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;you were disappointed when you saw me
again?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You thought I had become superficial, vacillating?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am,” she said, to my surprise. “I didn’t
know it. You gave me a shock, but you made me realize
it. You still think so?”</p>

<p>“My dear Anne,” I said carefully. “How can you be
otherwise? Everything is against you. What in life is
real to you, except pleasure? You’ve been shown nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
else in life&mdash;granted it isn’t your fault. You have
been cheated out of something bigger. Other women will
never notice it; thank heaven, you do. Now, to explain
what I felt on coming back out of the other world. Before,
I don’t suppose it ever would have occurred to me.
I took the American man’s point of view&mdash;from the best
of motives, I grant you&mdash;our attitude of chivalry towards
you. But, over there, something else has come to us, a
bigger conception of you, an ideal of service. That is
the difference in point of view.”</p>

<p>“But what am I to do?” she said, shrinking under the
directness of the opinion she had invited.</p>

<p>“Heavens, you’re making me talk like a confounded,
self-righteous prig,” I exclaimed, with a sudden realization,
“and God knows I’m far from that.”</p>

<p>“No, no! Say what you mean. You, you do not quite
trust my sincerity, do you?”</p>

<p>“Not quite.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because, well, because I think you are inclined to
dramatize your moods,” I said lightly. “I think you are
colored by the wish to please whomever you happen to be
with. We all are. But I wonder if to-night, when the
guests, the dreadful guests who bore you so, return, you
will find time so heavy on your hands?”</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, don’t <i>laugh</i> at me!” she cried,
flaring up with more show of feeling than I had seen.</p>

<p>“Forgive me. I won’t do that again,” I said contritely.
“Do you really care what I think?”</p>

<p>“You know I do.”</p>

<p>Her answer left me awkwardly floundering, until suddenly
she burst out:</p>

<p>“All you say is true: I do change, I do drift; what I
feel is true one moment will be different the next. But,
Davy, I realize it! Do you think I want to go on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
way? I do what I do because I am restless, just&mdash;just
to do something. You think I am superficial: I am, horribly
so. You think I crave pleasure&mdash;excitement: I
do. You think I like to play with emotions: I do. All
that’s true, and I know it.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if you know what harm you do?” I said, not
quite convinced.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Anne, I sometimes think good women do more harm
in this world than bad. They, poor devils, do so little
harm: they are so obvious. A moment’s madness, and
we throw ourselves violently back from them. To leave
them is to forget them. But you&mdash;you others&mdash;the
pain you inflict is given unconsciously.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t last,” she said.</p>

<p>“How do you know? Tell me one thing, Anne, because
it has always interested me. You didn’t need to tell me
there had been many men in your life: have you ever felt
any responsibility toward them? I mean this: have you
ever stopped to question your right to attract them, to
awaken their love, even when you knew there was no
interest on your part?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, of course not.”</p>

<p>“Probably not; such things are unconscious&mdash;an instinct.
And of a dozen men who come to love you, eight
or ten forget quickly. But some don’t, do they?”</p>

<p>“No, that’s true.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I mean by the harm good women do, unconsciously.
You would not give pain willingly, I am
sure, and yet I doubt if even you realize the sorrow that
has come from you. You may say it’s all in the game.
It is: but I go back to what I said&mdash;that often a girl
like yourself, like Molly, with everything to charm and
attract, leaves wounds behind that it takes years to
heal. That’s the strange thing about it; a friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
that is precious in the life of both, inevitably, by some
hidden spark of impulse, a sudden need of the soul, is
transformed into love on the part of one. Then, what
happens? Not only is the friendship taken out of the
lives of both, but to one that first joy of human contact
becomes emptiness and bitterness. It is not only of you
I am thinking, but of my own sister. When I saw Molly
again, so radiant, so lovely in her unconscious youth, so
eager for life to begin, I could not help thinking that
wherever she went, so lightly and so joyfully, she would
leave behind her many bruises and aches. Then, a few
real men will come to love her profoundly, and without
hope, and know the daily, hourly slavery to a hopeless
longing.”</p>

<p>“It is of yourself you are talking now, Davy?”</p>

<p>I stopped, thunderstruck. In my earnestness I had
quite forgotten how much my own personal feelings
must have given warmth to my statement.</p>

<p>“Of course, I did not expect that in all this time you
wouldn’t have fallen in love,” she said. She stood, looking
down. “It’s a queer world.” The next moment she
had started up the ravine, swinging from rock to rock,
with a challenge to me to follow. I hurried after her,
vexed at my own indiscreet revelations and seriously
alarmed at her reckless flight.</p>

<p>“Be careful. You’ll slip and turn your ankle. Anne,
you’re crazy!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, never slip!”</p>

<p>She darted up, heedless of my cautions, and when
finally I reached the top, quite out of breath, she was
watching me with a malicious smile from her seat in the
little observatory.</p>

<p>“Come up here and take a peep at the view. A fine
soldier, to be out-distanced by a woman!”</p>

<p>“That’s hardly fair,” I said, laughing and relieved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
pass from the dangerous seriousness of a moment ago.
“Give me a few more weeks.”</p>

<p>Instantly she was contrite.</p>

<p>“How thoughtless of me. Forgive me!”</p>

<p>“Very little to forgive. By George, that’s fine.” The
valley lay below us, blanketed with a sheen of snow that
in great spaces lifted occasionally for a glimpse of green;
black-blue shadows in the far hills, and faint, transparent
reds in the bared branches against the sky; the
whole tremulously still, a winter cameo cut in frozen
silences.</p>

<p>“Do you want to go back?” she said at last.</p>

<p>“I shall answer you as I answered your father; honestly,
no.”</p>

<p>“But then, why? Surely, after what you’ve been
through, in your condition, and it would be so easy to
arrange&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Exactly; but you, as my friend&mdash;would you want
me to stay?”</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>“Would you?”</p>

<p>“It is not your war.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t the point.”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> the point,” she said, in sudden rebellion. “No,
I don’t want you to go back. It’s absurd, unnecessary,
quixotic!”</p>

<p>Poor Anne. She little knew what harm she had done
by that one little outburst. I remembered Bernoline,
and, when next I looked at Anne, I saw only a child.</p>

<p>“And when we get into it? What then, young lady?”
I said, laughing. “Are you going to arrange everything
to suit yourself?”</p>

<p>“Davy, if you knew how you hurt me when you take
that tone,” she said, shrinking back. “I am not a child.”</p>

<p>“Then, Anne, you must face life as it comes to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
We can’t make it as we want it, but our kind, of all the
world, should never dodge a responsibility.”</p>

<p>“I always show you my worst side,” she said, shaking
her head, and presently, leading the way down the ravine
again, but this time more deliberately, she began to
chatter lightly of old memories without an approach to
intimacy, until the moment came for my departure.</p>

<p>“David, have you still such a bad opinion of me?” she
said, seeking the answer in my eyes.</p>

<p>“I never have had.”</p>

<p>“Funny: I am not at all myself with you. It’s because
I’m so used to looking up to you, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Because I am such an old bear, you mean.”</p>

<p>“No, no, that’s not what I mean. I’m very much of
a woman now&mdash;more than you can ever imagine&mdash;and
quite capable of determining my life for myself. And
I know what I want. And, David&mdash;don’t make one mistake.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’m not in love with you.”</p>

<p>Before I could recover myself, she had skipped up the
steps. And so ended this strange interview. Not being
myself in love with her, I could estimate more deliberately
the value of her last words, and yet, knowing in my
own experience all the wound to her pride that the fear
of my divining her true motives would bring, I think her
last defiance brought me into closer sympathy with my
old playmate.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>When I reached home, Ben and Letty were there,&mdash;come
for the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>“David!”</p>

<p>As I was hurrying through the hall, she called me to
her, where she was warming herself by the fireplace.</p>

<p>“You here?” I said, feigning surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<p>“B’rrr! You are cordial as an open door. They said
you were at the Brinsmades’.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Monsieur fait des conquêtes?</i>”</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders and disdained a reply, which
always irritated her.</p>

<p>“So you are in love&mdash;again, David?” she said, with
her provoking smile.</p>

<p>“Does this amuse you?”</p>

<p>“You forget that I remember the signs.”</p>

<p>At this I stared at her in such futile anger that she
laughed to herself, well content.</p>

<p>“But I quite approve! An excellent match for you!”</p>

<p>Then she deliberately dropped her muff, and as I
stooped to pick it up, she leaned over and pinched my ear.</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten that, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>?”</p>

<p>The muff was scented with the perfume I knew. I
came up angry and baffled.</p>

<p>“My dear Davy, if you are not going to pay me some
attention, you may as well go right to your brother and
tell all. The situation is evident.”</p>

<p>I left her in a vindictive, smoldering rage,&mdash;in one of
those moods of violence into which she had thrown me
a hundred times, out of her malicious pleasure. Does she
love me or hate me? Which is the explanation? As for
myself, the anger she awakened frightened me, for before
I was confident of my utter indifference. Is it possible
that by some baneful trick of habit there can remain a
vestige of the old tyranny over my senses? It is unthinkable!
If only I could go to Ben! But no, that is impossible!
And for a week, while we three are under the
same roof, this hideous comedy must go on!</p>

<p>As I go back over my interview with Anne, I am somewhat
puzzled. Why was I so brutally direct? I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
like to feel that it was an honest effort to repel her: yet
I wonder if I am as honest as all that and if underneath
is not the intuitive knowledge that just such an attitude
is what would draw her closer to me? How difficult it
is to know our real motives!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>This morning, in my mail, a note.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">David:</p>

<p>Don’t take what I say too literally. Of course, I would
never do anything to keep you from going back,&mdash;don’t
think I am that weak, sentimental type of woman. But I
might rebel at your going,&mdash;and that is very different, so long
as you keep it to yourself,&mdash;which I didn’t. If you don’t
think me quite hopeless, come in to-night for dinner.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Anne</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>I went, if for nothing but to escape from the situation
here. Mr. Brinsmade was there, and we had a long talk
on our prospects of getting into the war, which he feels
is certain. Anne sat by, listening, but studiously avoided
any opportunity for a tête-à-tête.</p>

<p>I am less sure of my attitude towards her. Last
night, with the mental eagerness which Brinsmade always
wakes in me, there, by the great fireplace, watching
her camped by her father’s knee&mdash;young, ardent, desirable&mdash;a
doubt came into my mind, I again saw my
life as it might be and, frankly, I was tempted. Fortunately,
Mr. Brinsmade had the tact not to broach the
subject again. After all, decisions are futile now. In a
few short weeks I shall be returning to France and there,
perhaps, will be the decision to all my perplexities. To-night,
when I suddenly stop at that realization, I am inclined
to break out into laughter. The irony of my
plaguing myself with questions now!</p>

<p>And yet it is torture: this memory of a few days’ utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
happiness, of one afternoon’s clear belief in the future!
I try to escape from it, but there is no escape, least of
all in the direction of Anne. That is not fair to her or
what might come. I sit long hours in Aunt Janie’s parlor,
pulling at my pipe before the fire and staring into the
coals. Of all the family she understands me best, and I
talk or remain silent, according to my mood. Yet when
I look at her, and realize the shadow of a life to which
she has been dedicated&mdash;everything denied, repressed,
throttled&mdash;I spring up in revolt and go tramping over
the countryside;&mdash;that life is beyond my strength!</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Christmas and the holidays have passed and certain
incidents stand out vividly. My own personal perplexities
have somehow receded into the healing background.
Our sorrows destroy us or themselves, some one has
said. There is a protecting instinct, perhaps, in the soul
as well as in the body. The healing fluids of the eye
isolate the intruding cinder, the membranes of the body
wrap around the splinter which penetrates the flesh;
so, insensibly, memory drops its curtains over our grief,
until the pain is lessened, and in fainter perception, we
can bear to look upon it. To the first poignant wrench
of my longing for Bernoline has come a sort of healing
incredulity. Is it a mood or an achieved attitude? Have
I definitely risen to a new philosophy of acceptance, or
will the old malaria of loneliness and emptiness return
when I am most sure of equanimity? These are things
I do not know.</p>

<p>I know only this: that of late I have been able to
get out of myself, to return to an objective point of view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
towards life: that the old desire to play my part is new
again; that I am not aloof but vibrantly a part of my day
and my nation, thrilled with the sudden rising anger at
temporizing that is sweeping the country,&mdash;a great,
mounting, climactic storm of wrath. The hour is coming,
I know, when America will show to the world and to
itself the majesty of its indignant pride.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Christmas night has always been open cheer with us
and, with me home, the house was crowded with friends
from the countryside and the village. They came in
sleighs and cutters, with jingling bells, wrapped in voluminous
scarfs, stamping in the great hallway, eager for the
good cheer of a gathering which took them back to the
rollicking days of Merrie England. Threescore, at least,
and for every man, woman and child some present on
the old tree. For we at Littledale have a custom that I
don’t remember seeing elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the back of the house, between the two wings, is a
stone-flagged court, and in the midst of it a splendid
cedar. It was Rossie’s idea as a child to convert it into
the Christmas symbol. So, promptly at ten, being well-fed
from the buffet of roast pig, fatted ducks, great
crisp turkeys, mountainous dishes of vegetables, pies
and cakes to stagger the imaginations of the youngest
eyes, every one bustles into coats and wraps and crowds
out into the court. There, the green tree is ablaze with
lanterns and tinsel wreaths, with a magnificent Santa
Claus to distribute the presents, with appropriate hits at
the idiosyncrasies of each recipient. The fiddles strike up
from the dining room. We join hands and go circling
round the tree, singing “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow,”
until every one is exhausted from laughter and panting
for breath, while the dogs go barking, in and out, frantic
with the spirit of good cheer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>This year, on account of my father’s health, we were in
some doubt. But the Governor, like the fine old trump
that he is, insisted that nothing be changed and watched
the celebration from an upper window. The rest of the
night was given up to square dances with old man
Carpenter calling out the figures from the midst of the
village fiddles. I wondered, watching the Governor, if
he would see another such Christmas, or, for that matter,
how many would dance so light-heartedly again. The
accent of the evening was absolute democracy,&mdash;every
one privileged to dance with every one else,&mdash;without
introductions, and much scrambling under the mistletoe.</p>

<p>Jenny, my first flame, was there,&mdash;a buxom matron,
with three ravenous youngsters. And once the hazards
of a quadrille brought us all together, Jenny, Ben, Letty,
Anne, and myself. In one figure, Ben and I being opposite
each other, Letty was at my side and Jenny at
his. I looked up at him and wondered if he remembered
the day, twelve years ago, when he saved me from utterly
throwing away my life. And the irony of it all,&mdash;that
I should have been away and powerless, when I
should have stood in his stead. Letty’s behavior throughout
the evening was outrageous, and Ben’s face grew
blacker and blacker. She flirted openly with several
young friends of Molly’s and deliberately with me, whenever
she could bring it before the notice of Anne. Of
course, knowing her of old, I realized that we were but
the pretexts; that her real object was to torture Ben himself.
And this alarmed me, for I saw already the progression
towards tragedy.</p>

<p>“Letty, let me warn you again,” I said to her, as we
were dancing. She had come to me herself, out of pure
malice, and to refuse would have been an open affront.</p>

<p>“Go on, Davy <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">mio</i>,” she said, under her breath.</p>

<p>“When Ben’s hands close about your little throat&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>they
won’t let go,” I said savagely, “and I don’t know
that they ought to.”</p>

<p>“David, I am bored&mdash;so bored!”</p>

<p>“I am not joking.”</p>

<p>“Anything for excitement,” she said, with her slow
smile. “La petite Anne is <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">éprise</i>. Be quite attentive,
Davy. You’ll land her. Now you are angry, but it seems
so natural to have you angry at me!”</p>

<p>“Since when have you danced in public?” I said, unwilling
to show her my disgust and my rage. “And why
now?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t fair to the man, do you think?” she said softly.</p>

<p>I stopped abruptly. What devil had made her say
this I don’t know: but she was right. I have danced with
hundreds of women, and never been conscious of what
I held in my arms,&mdash;until that dance with Letty.</p>

<p>“Thank you; I must see to something,” I said, leaving
her abruptly, and making a pretext of examining the
tree, I went out into the cold air, past the lanterned
courtyard, and down the crunching way to the old wooden
bridge by the duck pond.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>What a hideous situation, and how my whole being revolted
at the part I was forced to play! It is at such
moments that the old instinct of superstition that lies
dormant in each of us comes insistently back. I know
that in my old worldly wisdom I have scoffed at Sunday-school
morality and have seen as many sinners succeed
as fail. Yet at such moments when fate overtakes me I
go back to my childhood terror of pulpit thunderings and
feel the avenging justice of the Old Testament at my
back. It is no use repeating to myself that other men
have done much worse than I have done and, the memory
dropping away from them, become pillars of respectability.
I feel the ominous pursuit of consequences and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
hear the bitter cry of conscience,&mdash;“<i>The wages of sin
is death</i>.” Perhaps there are moments so personal in
our lives that all morality returns into one individual
experience, and right and wrong are momentarily but our
superstitious estimate of cause and effect as it suddenly
grips us.</p>

<p>Even as, in the bitter nausea of enforced hypocrisy, I
stood there in the darkness, a prey to my remorse, I
heard a step and knew that my brother was seeking me
out.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Ben?”</p>

<p>“I saw you leave.”</p>

<p>Then he had been watching us. The tone of his voice
warned me. Again, I should have to lie.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t stand it; had to break away.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>It was black as pitch&mdash;thank heaven for that&mdash;but
I felt as though through the obscurity his hot eyes were
watching the tortured agitation on my face.</p>

<p>“It’s not in my mood,” I said rapidly. “Should think
you’d understand. My God&mdash;with the Governor there&mdash;the
thought of going back in a few weeks&mdash;of all
that is coming to us&mdash;this dancing and merry-making
before&mdash;”</p>

<p>“David, are you <i>lying</i> to me?”</p>

<p>His hand closed over my wrist, and the phrase died on
my lips.</p>

<p>“Ben!”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, tell me the truth! What was there between
you and Letty?”</p>

<p>What would I not have given to have bared my conscience
to him; but it was not my life alone that was at
stake. There was the good name of the family. For a
moment, I felt lost in a sickly weakness, and hideous
possibilities seemed to strike at me out of the darkness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Then I recovered myself. I began to act. I acted as I
had never done before in my life. I caught him by the
shoulders and shook him.</p>

<p>“Ben, don’t be a damn fool!”</p>

<p>“Is that your answer?”</p>

<p>“Answer? How can I answer a crazy man? Do you
think if there had been, I should ever have come back
here? Do you?” In my emotion my hands cut into his
shoulders and, driven on by the force of circumstances,
I said fiercely, “No, I don’t approve of your marriage.
You are not happy. I knew you wouldn’t be. Women
like Letty never become real wives. Not that she will do
anything she oughtn’t to do&mdash;she is too cold-blooded&mdash;she
loves her little self more than she can ever love anybody
else&mdash;but the breath of her life is flattery and
adoration. God knows, I never wanted to tell you this&mdash;but
you’ve forced it out of me.”</p>

<p>“You’re telling me nothing new.”</p>

<p>“In heaven’s name, why did you do it, Ben?”</p>

<p>He started back at some thought suggested by this
outburst of mine.</p>

<p>“You know something about her, then&mdash;over there
in Paris?”</p>

<p>I caught myself. Every word, I felt, was dangerous,
and anything I might say a trap.</p>

<p>“Ben, do you realize we are discussing your wife?”
I said slowly. “Do you realize how impossible this conversation
is?”</p>

<p>“Damn it! You’re beating around the bush. You’re
my brother, and I have a right to know.”</p>

<p>“Letty is no different from the women of her set, here
or over there; no better, no worse. You have chosen to
take one of them for your wife. If you ask me has there
ever been any public scandal attached to her name, I can
say at once, no&mdash;absolutely not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re telling me the truth?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Thank God, at least for that!”</p>

<p>“As for the rest, I repeat, I don’t believe Letty has any
heart to give to you or to any one else. That may be
cold comfort, but I believe it.”</p>

<p>“If only I believed it!”</p>

<p>“You can. She is a child playing with toys. She must
have her toys, to play with and to break. Just at present,
because she sees she can torture you, she is amusing herself,
just as a child would with a woolly lamb&mdash;twisting
its legs. Whether she flirts with me or with a dozen men,
she’s not thinking of us; it’s you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ben, there’s only one thing to do: grin and bear it,
or&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Separate and divorce,” I said, and no sooner had I
said it than hope flared up in me,&mdash;the one hope of ending
a ghastly situation.</p>

<p>“It’s not so simple.”</p>

<p>“Do you care&mdash;still?”</p>

<p>He stood at my side without an answer.</p>

<p>“Ben, remember one thing.”</p>

<p>“The family&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;I hope to God I can remember
it,” he broke out. “Davy, sometimes I see so red
that&mdash;that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop talking like a fool,” I said angrily. “You’ve
chosen to do what you’ve done. You didn’t marry to
make a home or with the hope of having children, did
you? You married Letty, as half the men we know
marry&mdash;just in a blind instinct for possession. Now,
whatever happens, however you work it out, you’re not
going to do anything to disgrace the family. Keep that
in mind, Ben.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish to God I could go back with you and get into
it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“If I don’t&mdash;I don’t know what’ll happen,” he said,
very low. “Davy, it’s all very well for you to stand here
and say what you say. You’ve got a cold head. Do you
think a man in my position is normal? Do you think
that he knows what he is doing half the time? I tell you,
Davy, I’m afraid&mdash;afraid.”</p>

<p>My mind was made up on that instant.</p>

<p>“Ben, you know I’d do anything in the world for you,
don’t you? Will you trust me to make the decision for
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, after a moment.</p>

<p>“You are coming back with me.” I hesitated, and then
added: “For I’m afraid, too.”</p>

<p>So, it is agreed that we go off to France together, though
nothing is to be said of it for the present. That is three
weeks ahead; much can happen before then. Will he
hold to his determination? Will he find the strength to
wrench himself free of the slavery of the senses,&mdash;for
that is all there is to it? I don’t know. I can only wait,
fearful of the issue. I can only hope and pray.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Letty, I knew, would have noticed our absence and
be watching for our return, and though I didn’t see her
when we came into the hall, I was certain that somewhere
in the crowd her sharp, unquiet eyes were on us. Late
in the evening she came to me as I had expected.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Eh bien, Davy mio</i>, you are amusing yourself?”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“I am curious,” she said, looking at me intently.</p>

<p>I raised my hand to my throat significantly and the look
in my eyes must have frightened her, for she attempted
no more persiflage but moved away, rather still and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
serious for the rest of the evening. Perhaps, at the bottom
of her feline soul, there is a touch of genuine fear
and&mdash;a desire to live.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I thought the evening would never end. Anne reproached
me for my gloominess and went off early, hurt,
I know, at my seeming indifference. I do not love her, I
am sure of that; and yet I cannot bear to see a certain
wounded look in her eyes!</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>To-day, a strange conversation with Molly,&mdash;strange,
for all at once I seemed to know the human being with
whom I had lived all these years. Until now, I had
thought of her only as a lovely child, something soft and
gentle, a laugh that was good to hear, a smiling face,
content, as you enjoy a graceful animal, a bit of sunshine
and the fragrance of the violet beds. Now, to my
astonishment, I perceive a woman; a directness of vision;
a delicate perception of standards and a firmness of
purpose.</p>

<p>She came in late from a skating party over at the
Brinsmades’, where I had purposely not gone, and, at the
first glance of her telltale countenance, I knew that something
had happened. In the hall she caught my hand.</p>

<p>“Come upstairs with me, Davy, just a minute.”</p>

<p>“Up it is, young lady.”</p>

<p>Much intrigued and a little apprehensive, I followed
her into the blue sitting room and closed the door. The
next moment she was in my arms, weeping out her heart
on my shoulder.</p>

<p>“Oh, Davy, Davy, I had to come to some one!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>“But, good heavens, what’s wrong?” I was thinking
of Letty and wondering.</p>

<p>“I am so miserably unhappy!”</p>

<p>“Then talk it out with me. It’ll do you good.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Davy, some one wants to marry me!”</p>

<p>I started to burst out laughing at this and suddenly
checked myself. I held her from me, her shoulders in
my hands, and said, with a swift jealousy:</p>

<p>“You child! What right have you to be thinking of
such things!”</p>

<p>“What things, Davy?”</p>

<p>“Falling in love, and marriage.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not in love&mdash;and that’s just the awful part
of it! It’s of him I’m thinking. It’s so terrible to think
that a man has fallen in love with you, that he cares as
much as all that&mdash;when you know you can’t&mdash;you
never will. I&mdash;I feel as though I had committed a
crime!”</p>

<p>I took her into my arms again and I think I never
loved her, my little sister, as I did at that moment. If
this were American womanhood, I felt a sudden thrill of
pride!</p>

<p>“Perhaps, it is not so serious&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is, it is,” she protested, hiding her face against my
shoulder. “If you had seen his face! I was so sorry for
him, Davy. It’s terrible that he should come to care like
that! Oh, don’t laugh at me&mdash;there’s no one else to
go to but you&mdash;and do try to understand!”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t laugh at you, bless your honest little heart,
and I think I understand,” I said, wondering a little if
she knew her true feelings. “Is this the first time any
man has proposed&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I saw it coming, and I dreaded it so, and
when I couldn’t prevent it I was so frightened. He was
so terribly in earnest, and his face went so white. I&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>I
couldn’t say a thing,&mdash;I just burst into tears and ran
away. Oh, David, I feel so guilty. I can’t bear that any
one should be so unhappy as that&mdash;just over me!”</p>

<p>“This is what life means, little sister,” I said, drawing
her down beside me on the old chintz sofa. “These are
the things no one can protect us from. And now, tell
me, are you quite sure of your own feelings?”</p>

<p>She raised her eyes, her eyes clear as Bernoline’s, to
me and in that moment I felt the spiritual kinship of true
womanhood that lies underneath all social divisions.</p>

<p>“It will be a long time before I shall fall in love. I
am only a girl now, Davy. I want to be a woman first,
to have read and thought much. For I want to be fit to
be at the head of my home and for the lives that may
come to me.”</p>

<p>“Do you really feel that way, Molly dear?”</p>

<p>“Can any one feel differently about such things?”</p>

<p>I bent over her hand and caught it to my lips.</p>

<p>“That is the only right way&mdash;the natural way to
think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, David, I do want to talk to you so much! You
see, I never can, with mother: you know how it is.
There’s only you, Davy. I don’t love Ted. I’m sure I
never will love him, but it seems so terrible that I should
lose the other&mdash;the real friendship&mdash;and yet I suppose
that’s not possible&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not quite fair to him.”</p>

<p>“No, and Ted is the only one to think about, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Ted?”</p>

<p>“Ted Seaver.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, the tall one, with dark hair,” I said, seeing
confusedly one of the many who had passed through the
house. “Why, he’s only a boy. What right had he&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s just it; but, of course, he’s not such a boy:
he’s twenty-three, and he couldn’t help saying what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
did. And I did respect him for the way he did it. Only&mdash;only
such things are way off&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I should hope so.”</p>

<p>“It would have to be some one&mdash;some one very much
of a man&mdash;whom I could look up to&mdash;some one much
stronger than I am&mdash;who has been really tested and
come through.” Again she looked at me and, suddenly
laying her hand over mine, said: “Some one like you,
Davy.”</p>

<p>The look of clear faith as her face lit up somehow
searched into my heart and left me humble and regretful.
I looked down at her white hand against my dark one,
and Jessica’s words came into my mind,</p>

<p>“So shines a good deed in a naughty world.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you came to me, Molly,” I said, “and I
value your confidence very deeply. Suppose we snuggle
up before the fire and talk lots of things out!”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you only would!”</p>

<p>I touched a match to the tinder, wheeled her into position
and sat down beside her. She leaned forward, her
hands clasped over her knees, her look sunk in the climbing
flame.</p>

<p>“It’s such a pity!”</p>

<p>“What, Molly?”</p>

<p>“It is such a sad thing to think, David, that it can’t just
remain a friendship. I am thinking of the friend I have
lost. There are many girls who are terribly excited about
men&mdash;falling in love with them. I’m not that way.
I only wish&mdash;because in the end it’s you who lose&mdash;isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“How long have you known him?”</p>

<p>“Ted? Almost a year.”</p>

<p>She looked, and saw the lingering question in my eye.</p>

<p>“Oh, David, you don’t understand me at all!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I do, but sometimes&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>“If I cared for him, do you think I’d tell any one&mdash;even
you?”</p>

<p>This brought me up sharp. I laughed, quite amazed,
and not at all sure that I liked it.</p>

<p>“That’s a rather queer way of putting it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tease me, David. You understand.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that means, young lady,” I said, thinking
of something I had been impelled to write a few days
ago, “that when the time comes, you’ll go whisking out
of this house on the arm of some stranger, without even
saying ‘by your leave’.”</p>

<p>“If you mean shall I decide for myself&mdash;of course,
David!”</p>

<p>“And even a big brother’s advice&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, David; not even you. How can any one else
know? And then, think of the responsibility of deciding
such a thing! If I really cared, I should believe in him,
no matter what any one would tell me.”</p>

<p>“Molly,” I said, a bit surprised though to find myself
playing the part of Wisdom, “I am not much worried
about you. You will make no mistake. There’s an
honest, direct way you have of facing life that I think
I can trust. Only, I want you to value yourself very
high, and I’m afraid sometimes that just because you
are so straightforward and unselfish you may not realize
what you are worth.”</p>

<p>“That’s very dear of you,” she said pensively. “Of
course, I won’t pretend to you that I don’t&mdash;well, that
I don’t sometimes look ahead and wonder. Of course,
I do. And I have a very high ideal.”</p>

<p>“It is so easy to make mistakes. It’s when you want
to love, my dear little sister, that it is easy to believe you
do love. Such awful mistakes can be made.”</p>

<p>“Now you are thinking of Ben,” she said irrelevantly.</p>

<p>“No, no, I was thinking of myself,” I said hastily, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Letty was a subject I could not discuss with her. “Do
you know, if I hadn’t been prevented&mdash;I would&mdash;well,
I don’t want to say I would have&mdash;I might have thrown
away my whole life on a mad suicidal marriage?”</p>

<p>“I know,” she said, nodding her head.</p>

<p>“You know? What do you mean?” I said, startled.</p>

<p>“Don’t be angry, David. I guessed. It was Jenny
Barnett, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>I laughed, to cover my confusion and my amazement,&mdash;a
not very successful laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was Jenny; and that’s why I say be very sure,
just at first.”</p>

<p>“But, David, I am not like you. You have always
been so impulsive, so intense.”</p>

<p>“I impulsive?” I cried, forgetting how the conversation
had switched. And I was genuinely amazed, for frankly,
it had never occurred to me to look at myself as such.
Though I am not sure but what she is right, but how
she learned to see me so clearly is beyond me.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are! I never know what you’re going to do;
whereas I&mdash;I am really quite sensible and matter-of-fact.
Why haven’t <i>you</i> married, David? You ought to.”</p>

<p>“I thought, young lady, we were here to discuss your
affairs,” I said warily.</p>

<p>“Please, David, let me talk to you,” she said, raising
her eyes to mine. “I love you very much, more than any
one else in the world. And we ought to be very close to
each other, real confidants.”</p>

<p>“Now, what’s coming?” I thought to myself, but, putting
on a brave front, I answered, “Fire away, then.”</p>

<p>“I feel you are unhappy. I feel it so strongly.”</p>

<p>“I am neither happy nor unhappy,” I said, being on
my guard. “All I am thinking about now is going back
and doing my duty, because it is quite immaterial, so
long as the war lasts, what I plan to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>“I am thinking of Anne.”</p>

<p>“Now, we have it! Young lady, there is such a thing
as imagining you see too much.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, David,” she said, not paying the
slightest attention to me, “that it would be kinder, more
honest, if you told her&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Told her what?”</p>

<p>“That you love some one else.”</p>

<p>I jumped at this, in great wrath.</p>

<p>“Extraordinary! Child, where did you imagine&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t be angry, David. You needn’t tell me if you
don’t want to&mdash;but I know. I’ve seen it in your face
too often, these days. Only, I think it’s hard on Anne.”</p>

<p>I decided on another course.</p>

<p>“My dear Molly, Anne isn’t in the slightest doubt as
to my feelings towards her. I wish I did love her,
sometimes. I don’t. And if I did, I shouldn’t tell her so&mdash;just
as I was going off to war.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because a man has no right to take a woman’s heart
when it may mean an empty life for the rest of her
existence.”</p>

<p>“But why, David? If you men are willing to give your
lives, why should we women not have our part of
sorrow?”</p>

<p>“Each as he feels: that’s my point of view,” I said.
Yet, as I look at it now, I wonder why I said it, for no
such compunction had arrested my impulse toward
Bernoline. “However, that’s all academic and don’t get it
into your romantic little head that I’m not telling you
the truth about Anne. Furthermore, she understands.”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“I’m inclined to shake you!” I said, vexed.</p>

<p>The next moment her arms closed about me.</p>

<p>“David, I can’t bear to see you unhappy; that’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>As I look back on this conversation, I am the more
amazed. Where did she get such uncanny insight into my
thoughts? What had not her child’s eyes divined?&mdash;if
they had ever been the eyes of a child! I suppose my
irritation arose from the fact that she had come too close
to my own misgivings. No, I am not quite sure that I
have been honest with Anne, even when I assured myself
that I was. Before I leave I shall see Anne again.
To-night, I know what I shall say: but I am not sure
what it will be at the time.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>IX</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>New York</i></p>

<p>I am here with Ben at the hotel and at noon, day after
to-morrow, we sail for France. To me, as to him, it is
an escape from a hideous situation. All day I have
tramped the streets, seeking in the crowds a glimpse of
Bernoline. Twice I came to the steps of St. Rosa’s
Convent,&mdash;tempted. If I had any doubt as to the lasting
wound that is in my heart, I know now. To be in
this city, where she walks hidden in the wilderness of
human beings, where at every turn I look for her!
There is nothing here for me&mdash;nothing! I want to get
back to the other life&mdash;to be from morning to night
a pawn in the fingers of fate&mdash;to have every decision
made for me&mdash;to surrender my initiative&mdash;to accept
what can’t be changed&mdash;to perform without question.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>But to go back. The leave-taking was hard, the shadow
was over it all. If I come back&mdash;and who knows?&mdash;one
place will be empty. But first, Anne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>For days I had not seen her. Each consciously avoided
the other. Yet a good deal of what Molly had said
haunted me: I could not depart without some explanation.
We left Sunday. Friday afternoon I called her
up on the telephone, and asked if I might come over,&mdash;a
strange conversation, full of long pauses and hesitations,
where I could not see her face and could only wonder.</p>

<p>“I am going Sunday&mdash;you know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know.”</p>

<p>“And I really would like to see you before then.”</p>

<p>“But, David, I’m leaving in an hour.”</p>

<p>Curiously enough, this upset me more than I would
have thought.</p>

<p>“Leaving? Where?” I asked stupidly.</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>“Anne!”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“And to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“But I am leaving in an hour for a week end.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then I shan’t see you. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“You should have let me know before.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course. My fault. Well, I suppose it
can’t be helped.”</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“When do you leave?”</p>

<p>“In an hour.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m afraid it’s good-by over the telephone.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t been very friendly, you know.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>Another silence.</p>

<p>“Will you write to me once in a while?”</p>

<p>“Do you want me to, David?”</p>

<p>“Please.”</p>

<p>“Very well&mdash;once in a while.”</p>

<p>Now this was not the turn I had wished to give to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
parting, but some sudden feeling of the blankness of her
eyes caused me to relent.</p>

<p>“So, it’s good-by, Anne, and&mdash;I’m sorry it’s to be
like this.”</p>

<p>“It is not my fault.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;good-by, and good luck&mdash;Davy.”</p>

<p>The last was almost inaudible. I put up the receiver
and went to my room and puttered around nervously
with my packing, not at all quiet in my mind and frankly
missing something out of my day.</p>

<p>In the middle of the afternoon, all at once, I determined
to fling on my things and go out for a tramp, to calm my
irritation. I had hardly passed the postern when who
should come whirling up the road in her cutter, bells
jangling, snow clouds flying, but Anne, with her cheeks
aflame.</p>

<p>“Jump in.”</p>

<p>I clambered to the seat by her side and we were off so
precipitately that I caught at her arm to save myself a
tumble. Away we went, skipping over the crinkling snow,
the sharp wind whipping at our cheeks, long minutes
without a word, until Littledale and the outskirts were
left behind in a whirling maze. At Muncie’s Woods she
drew in suddenly and under the green canopy of the evergreens
we slowed to a walk.</p>

<p>“There was no house party,” she said, staring ahead.</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>“How did you know?”</p>

<p>“I knew.”</p>

<p>“What a spiteful, irrational, idiotic person you must
think me.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;very human.”</p>

<p>She shook her head, and I thought her lip trembled
a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s always so, and I can’t help it. I’m always doing
the wrong thing with you.”</p>

<p>I did not answer this, for I was afraid to.</p>

<p>“It’s been a miserably unsatisfactory time,” she said,
flicking the horses suddenly with her whip, so that they
pranced about for quite a moment before she could control
them. “I had looked forward so much to your
coming, to going back to the old days, Davy. They were
the best&mdash;and instead, we have only been fencing with
each other. We never say what we mean. And I&mdash;I
show you my very worst self&mdash;my worst! Everything
I say to you, you misunderstand.”</p>

<p>“There you are wrong.”</p>

<p>“You do, you do! You are always ascribing to me
motives that aren’t there, and so, David, there are two
things I can’t bear from you, ridicule, and&mdash;pity!”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, nothing is further from my mind.”</p>

<p>“That’s not true,” she said obstinately. “David, why
can’t we say the things we think to each other? Is there
any reason?”</p>

<p>“It is sometimes rather hard, Anne, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“There you go! But if we don’t&mdash;don’t you see that
we lose all that was so wonderful, so rare, so genuine
that we once had. And this is what is happening.” Still
she had not looked at me. Her mood changed and she
drew the lash of her whip over the steaming flank of a
horse. When she spoke it was gravely and with determination,
the voice of a woman. “David, I do not think
any harm can come from being absolutely honest, and
sometimes, for not being so, a whole destiny may be
changed. David, whatever you think I am&mdash;I am not
in love with you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I never&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am not in love with you, but I can imagine&mdash;some
day&mdash;if I did&mdash;if I was&mdash;well, marrying you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>The next moment the whip had struck across the glistening
back and we shot out into a gallop.</p>

<p>“Stop!” I cried out, but she only shook her head, bending
lower to hide her face that was aflame with confusion.</p>

<p>“Stop!”</p>

<p>I caught the reins from her and brought our perilous
rocking flight to a halt. Then I turned to her. Poor
child, I knew what the suspense of that moment meant
to her! I could almost feel her heart stand still; even
then, thank heaven, I did not abuse the situation&mdash;at
least, I think not&mdash;and heaven knows how easy it would
have been!</p>

<p>“Anne, dear little friend, I think more of you at this
minute than I ever have, for saying that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Davy, I shall want to kill myself to-night for&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, don’t say that. Now, I am going to be just as
honest with you.”</p>

<p>I saw her hand steal up to her throat and hurried on
to end the suspense.</p>

<p>“I feel just as you do. I am not in love with you,
and yet I can imagine, just as you said, that if some day
I married you a great happiness would come into my life.
Would to God I could say more!”</p>

<p>She turned for the first time as I began to speak and
her eyes went to mine. I had a strange premonition
there in the green light of the forest, in the stillness of
the carpeted woods, the stillness that was in her listening
face, that beyond the inscrutable future, through what
twisted tormented ways I know not, in some final calm,
just for the strange incongruous daring of that moment,
Anne and I would end as husband and wife. Premonition
or illusion,&mdash;I write it down as I felt it.</p>

<p>“Will you really believe me?” she said, and her glance
went down, “when I say that I should never, never have
said even this if&mdash;if it were not that you are going back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
and everything else seems so little beside that. Will you
understand that I can be like this, that without being in
love I can look into the future and see what may come?
David, it’s&mdash;it’s so hard to say&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. Say just what you feel, and then I
shall be just as honest.”</p>

<p>“You have always been different in my life, David.
Other men have just been shells. You I’ve known, and
you’ve known me. It isn’t that, oh, since we are talking
this way, it’s this: I know my weaknesses, Davy&mdash;oh,
so well&mdash;and I know what I’ll become if I marry a certain
type of man. It’s what you bring out in me, the
thing I want to be when I’m with you. Of course, it
sounds terribly&mdash;I’m ashamed to say it. No, don’t
look at me; but David, I can say this&mdash;when you come
back&mdash;some day, when it’s all over&mdash;I shan’t have
changed.”</p>

<p>“Shan’t have what?”</p>

<p>“Changed,” she said, in a whisper.</p>

<p>I felt my eyes blurred. What wouldn’t I have given
to have been able at that moment, in perfect honesty, to
have taken her into my arms for her sake&mdash;and for
mine!</p>

<p>“Anne,” I said, “let me tell you this,&mdash;for you will
want to know this when you look back to-night: never
regret what you have done. We have come closer together
this afternoon than ever before, and you have
done it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean it, Davy?” she said, looking up, her
eyes shining so that it was hard to resist them.</p>

<p>“I do. From now on I shall always know the strength
of a woman&mdash;a very real woman&mdash;that is in you. You
have left a memory that I shall hold in great reverence.
Between us now there will be always absolute honesty;
and that is something to build on. Hold what we have,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
dear friend, and let us both have some faith in the
future.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, David,” she said, with a touch of wistfulness.
Then, “And now, tell me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you want to hear? It will hurt you.”</p>

<p>“I only know that you are unhappy. And, David, I
think that is the reason, the real reason I have come to
you.”</p>

<p>It was hard to begin, for I, too, shrunk from the pain
I knew I would give her. Presently, she said, looking up
at my clouded face:</p>

<p>“There was some one else&mdash;”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“Of course, I knew there was.”</p>

<p>“There is.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“But it is quite hopeless,” I added hastily.</p>

<p>“Quite hopeless?” she said, looking at me, and so
strange are the ways of the heart, that, I believe, that was
the only thought she seized upon.</p>

<p>“I only knew her for ten days. I shall never see her
again. I have promised.”</p>

<p>“It hurts?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry.” She laid her hand on my arm and looked
away. “Is&mdash;is it because she’s married, David?”</p>

<p>Strange to say, the suggestion came to me like a flash
of lightning in the darkness of my perplexity. Never
once had such an explanation occurred to me. I thought
it over and wondered.</p>

<p>“You needn’t answer.”</p>

<p>“I do not think so,” I said, without thinking how
strange this must sound. “I don’t know&mdash;I hardly know
anything about her. We are entirely apart in everything,&mdash;race,
tradition, faith.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<p>“And if it were not hopeless, David?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me.”</p>

<p>We drove on in silence, each to his own thoughts. In
the end it was Anne who spoke.</p>

<p>“Just one question: is&mdash;is she there&mdash;in France?”</p>

<p>“No. She is here. That I said is true. She is gone
utterly out of my life. It was her decision. Why? I
don’t even know. It was all very beautiful and very
tragic. It is over&mdash;all except the forgetting.” I drew
a long breath and turned to her. “That is going to be a
hard fight, but it must be done. I wonder if I should
have told you this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes! You should have told me.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Anne&mdash;I want you to know this, too.
With what we have been to each other&mdash;we are now&mdash;I
should never ask anything of you unless I did love you
with my whole heart. That is your right. This is a
strange conversation, but I think you know me well
enough to believe that!”</p>

<p>“Of course, David.”</p>

<p>She looked at me, and her eyes suddenly were filled
with tears.</p>

<p>“I wish I could feel that you needed me a little.”</p>

<p>“Good God! But have I the right!”</p>

<p>Then, she did a thing I shall never forget,&mdash;that only
comes to the intuition of the woman who loves. She
drew off her glove and laid her bare hand in mine. And
so, speaking little, we returned.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Is it possible, I wonder, that with one’s heart filled with
the ache and anguish of a love that is denied any hope,
the soul in its defensive instinct can look ahead and know
what some future date may bring? For, to-day, I can
say this with perfect honesty: I need to keep Anne in
my life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>The last moments in the old home were harder than I
had thought. Aunt Janie was the bravest of them all,
not excepting the mater, but then, Aunt Janie, bless her
heart, is of the heroic line. Molly has come on to see
us off, though I begged her not to. The hardest was saying
good-by to the Governor. During the weeks of my
return he had seemed to pick up famously, until we had
almost begun to hope. But, at the last, all the light went
out of his face. And when I leaned down suddenly and
kissed him, his fingers clung to my hand until I had
gently to release them. I had left this till the last minute
and hurried out into the hall, where Molly put her arms
around me and took me to the sleigh. For one thing I
am profoundly thankful: he remembered Alan, and I
carry to him the old daguerreotype of the Governor as a
young man.</p>

<p>At the station every one in the village waited. The
Littledale Band played “The Marseillaise” and other patriotic
airs, amid great waving of handkerchiefs and
cheering. You would have thought I was a candidate for
Governor. But I was too affected to do anything but
wave back.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>What Ben has said to Letty I do not know. He seldom
speaks, but a certain grimness settles over him as he paces
up and down. I’m afraid that it has cost him more than
he thought to tear himself away from her. To-night
everything seems confused and out of joint,&mdash;Anne,
Bernoline, the Governor, Ben, Letty; myself most of
all. Again, the close of another chapter&mdash;the wrench
of old associations&mdash;new hazards, and what beyond?</p>

<p>If only I could see <i>her</i> once more!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>X</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>New York</i></p>

<p>I have seen her, by some miracle of coincident, or by
a destiny which never seems to leave me. It is midnight,
and I have been sitting here, my head in my hands, my
brain galloping, going over and over every word, every
look. I have seen her, talked to her, held her in my arms!
What is the trick destiny has played on me? What is
my mood to-night? Exaltation, or the sense of having
bound myself irrevocably to tragedy? At one moment
the wildest hopes surge up in me: I live in fantastic daydreams
with a belief in some miraculous, healing Providence.
At the next I am dropped into bottomless despair,
and I see no end but unfulfilled longing and the emptiness
of denial. And so, what I have longed for, to see her
once again, has come, and I don’t know which is the
stronger,&mdash;the joy of hoping or the pain of certainty.</p>

<p>All day long I had sought her, aimlessly, without a
plan, weary of spirit, without a hope, but with a prayer
on my lips, as even men of no faith pray in a last hope,
when all other means have failed them. Towards evening
the thought came to me to seek her in the calm of vaulted
spaces, and I went into the Cathedral, and, from there,
into the Church of the Dominican Fathers. Then the
inspiration came to me that if she were anywhere it would
be in the little French Church of the Franciscans. No
sooner had this idea come to me than a strange sense of
certainty possessed me. I went there, absolutely convinced
that I would find her.</p>

<p>Yet, at my entrance, as I stood with incredulous,
blinded eyes, peering into the hollow obscurity, my heart
sank. And then I saw her!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p>How I knew that the kneeling figure by the little altar
of the Virgin was Bernoline, I do not know, but I knew.
My heart seemed to stop. I leaned against a pillar and
waited. The great vaulted supports rose up and closed
above me somewhere in the night. Far off I heard a
slipping step. Through the church a dozen tiny lights
burned silently. At her altar the Mother of Sorrows
looked down out of the shadow of the ages. She was
on her knees, the mellow points of the votive candles
lighting her uplifted face in a glow of serene radiance.
So I saw her again, as I had imagined her a hundred
times, when I knew she returned to me in her
prayers.</p>

<p>There are pictures which remain in memory’s galleries.
This will never fade.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Something of my presence she must have felt, for all
at once her hand was arrested in mid-air, and she turned
and met my look. Instantly I came forward and knelt
at her side. I saw her lips open and over her face the
wonder of a living miracle. I know now that my name
was on her lips at that very moment, and that in her
simple faith she saw the answer. Her great dark eyes
met mine. I saw her breast rise. Her pale slender hand
went to her throat, and in that first unwavering look I
knew at last how I was loved.</p>

<p>“Bernoline, it is God’s will.”</p>

<p>“It is you. I prayed that I might see you once again.”</p>

<p>She laid her hand on mine, bidding me wait, and went
off into the stony vastness. Presently I heard the step
I knew from all others returning. A pervading sense of
happiness such as I had never known filled my whole
being at the knowledge that she was drawing near, that
she whom I loved was coming back to me. When I raised
my eyes she was at my side, tenderness and pride in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
face, and in her hand a thin white taper. She knelt again.</p>

<p>“Mother, I thank thee,” she said.</p>

<p>She rose and, lighting the wick at the wavering crown
of tiered tapers, placed it so that it dominated all the
rest.</p>

<p>“Your light, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>,&mdash;above the crowd, always;
strong, proud and true.”</p>

<p>Then kneeling, she made the sign of the cross, and as
a smile of thankfulness touched her lips, I knew that she
prayed for me.</p>

<p>I forgot all the complex world of realities: actions and
reactions of our mortal nature; doubts, questionings,
logic and tradition. There, in the silence and the shadows,
purity at my side, mystery above me, my spirit
took wings with the faith that was hers. I do not think
that I uttered a prayer, yet it was a prayer, for at that
moment I believed as a child believes.</p>

<p>When she touched my arm I rose and followed her.
At the end of the aisle, a mutual impulse made us turn.
The candle, my candle, shone out bravely above the rest.</p>

<p>“You will remember?”</p>

<p>“Always.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>When we emerged into the strange, jarring world, the
healing dusk was stealing over the hard outlines. For a
moment we walked silently, our hearts too full, unable
to speak to each other.</p>

<p>“To-morrow I sail for France.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow?” she cried, with a little catch in her
voice.</p>

<p>“You will walk a little way with me? A last time?”</p>

<p>“How could I help it, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>?”</p>

<p>She looked at me and smiled her sad little smile, and
I saw in her eyes the weariness of the struggling against
the call of her heart. A great hope came to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought you would wait for America,” she said, and
now her eyes no longer avoided mine but seemed never
to leave my face.</p>

<p>“I’m going back to the Legion and, of course, the moment
we go in, and that can’t be long, I shall be transferred.”</p>

<p>“You are well?”</p>

<p>“Entirely.”</p>

<p>What did it matter what we said? I think neither of
us really knew. I saw only the light that shone in her
eyes, and in the joy of being together neither the past
nor the future nor the things about us existed. I took
her arm and slowed my pace to the meditative step I
knew so well, and together, heads bowed and still too
happily oppressed by all we had to say to each other, we
went silently towards the Park, each content with the
knowledge of the other’s presence. It was the hour when
the city, like another Cinderella, steps out of the drab
and homespun of the day into the beaded fairy raiment
of the twilight; when through the hard and hazy battlements
something soft and gentle tempers the air; when
the clamor of strident sounds lingers faintly in the drowsy
distance and polyglot ugliness masks itself behind half-shadows
and fleeting forms.</p>

<p>“Ah, Davy, I did want to see you again,” she said,
without subterfuge, in the honesty of her nature, as only
her nature could be honest. “I wanted to see you strong&mdash;yourself.
I wanted to know that I had not brought
you weakness and sorrow. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon ami</i>, tell me that it is
so.”</p>

<p>We had wandered into the Park, through obscure winding
paths, the argus-eyed city receding against the darkling
sky, the lake at our feet, and only an occasional
passer-by hurrying on his way. At the bridge we stopped,
leaning over, shoulder to shoulder, each of us under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
spell of the silence which visited us, and afraid of the
test that words would bring.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you anything that is not true,&mdash;even
for your sake,” I said at last.</p>

<p>“No, David.”</p>

<p>“But first, you. How has it gone with you? It has
been hard, Bernoline?”</p>

<p>“No, no.”</p>

<p>“That is the truth?”</p>

<p>“Yes, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>. It has not been hard. I have found
great kindness. I am companion in the family of a true
gentlewoman.”</p>

<p>“Bernoline, I cannot bear to think of you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush; it is so little when you think of what has come
to other women.”</p>

<p>“Bernoline, you do not know how I have fought to
keep my promise. I’ve gone by St. Rosa’s Convent a
dozen times, and twice I wrote you letters,&mdash;only to
tear them up.”</p>

<p>“But you won out, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>. I knew you would.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but there is no happiness in it.”</p>

<p>“Must I always hurt you, Davy?” she said sadly, “I
who only long to protect you? Dear friend, all I have
done&mdash;believe me, though you cannot understand it&mdash;has
been done for you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Bernoline.”</p>

<p>I felt that the moment had come when the happiness
of my whole life was there in my hands to fight for. We
were no longer man and woman, but two atoms in the
wavering sea of multitudes,&mdash;atoms gravitating towards
each other, cleaving together despite opposition and circumstance,
despite all the forces of society that laboriously
and fruitlessly lay their inhibitions against the
great sweeping instincts of race.</p>

<p>“Night and day, David, I have had you in my prayers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
I have prayed that our meeting&mdash;our knowing each
other&mdash;would leave no wound in you. Ah, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>,
if I do this strange thing, to be here alone with you, it
is because I must know that I am not to carry that remorse
through all my life.” She stopped, as though
dreading what she might be led to say, and then, staring
down at the stars that swam in the dark waters below us,
she added slowly: “I shall never be sure&mdash;never&mdash;until
I know that you are in your own home, married and
happy.”</p>

<p>Then I broke out.</p>

<p>“Bernoline, are you quite honest with yourself?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that is not the true reason. Bernoline, if you
are here, to-night, alone at my side, it is because you
cannot help it&mdash;because you love me. Oh, why hide
from ourselves what is?”</p>

<p>“No, no! Don’t say that!”</p>

<p>“Bernoline, Bernoline, why deny it?” I cried, bending
over her. “You don’t deceive me; you don’t deceive
yourself! What stands between us? What can stand?
What do we care? What else counts but this thing we
feel, here, now, at this very moment! We know. You
know, as I know. Happiness, Bernoline? Do you think
in the whole world there is any happiness for me away
from you&mdash;from the longing for you, day and night!
Bernoline, I tell you, you have never been an hour away
from me. I have had you before my eyes; I have talked
with you; lived over a thousand times each moment
spent with you. Bernoline, turn to me, look at me, tell
me&mdash;”</p>

<p>Do I know what I said, there in the deep pool of the
night! It is not words, but accents, that we hear at
such times. I don’t know that she heard me any more
than I can remember the torrent of pleading that surged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
to my lips, but I know that she, too, felt the snapping of
cords, the longing of my arms to reach out and draw her
up to me, the wild triumphant force beating down all our
little struggling, closing about us and confounding us in
one impulse, one desire, for, all at once, she swayed from
me and began to tremble, crying: “Don’t touch me,
David. I can’t stand it&mdash;don’t!”</p>

<p>“But why, in heaven’s name, why?” Her voice stirred
all my compassion, but the thought that I was fighting
for my happiness, her happiness, was stronger. I came
closer. “Bernoline, what is it? Pride? Is that all? Do
you think I care who you are, what you are, what was
your family, or anything else? You are you. And now,
listen to me, Bernoline. To-morrow, I go back. Marry
me to-night; be my wife. Let me take that with me in
my heart!”</p>

<p>“If I could, if I only could!” she burst out suddenly.</p>

<p>“You can, you will,” I said, with a sudden sense of
triumphant victory, pitiless, as in love we are driven to
show no mercy. “Bernoline, whatever it is, I have the
right to share it. Yes, the right. Nothing else matters
but you in my life. Do you understand? You are
life!”</p>

<p>She turned to me, struggling against herself, her hands
clasped, and again the terror in her eyes.</p>

<p>“I can’t. I can’t.”</p>

<p>“But why, <i>why</i>?”</p>

<p>Suddenly, like a flash, I remembered the first instinctive
question of Anne’s. My heart contracted so sharply
that for a moment I could not voice the terrible doubt.</p>

<p>“Bernoline&mdash;is there&mdash;any one else&mdash;who has a
right?”</p>

<p>She stood, staring at me. Twice her lips moved,
parted, trembled, and refused to utter the answer. Her
hands gripped the coping, and I saw her arms stiffen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>“Bernoline, you are&mdash;married!” I said, in a whisper.
“Is it that?”</p>

<p>Still she did not answer.</p>

<p>“Bernoline, for God’s sake, say it is not that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes&mdash;it is&mdash;that!”</p>

<p>I should not have known her voice.</p>

<p>“Good God! Why didn’t you tell me before?”</p>

<p>I was stunned; yet it seemed as though I had always
known&mdash;that it could have been nothing else. The
world went black before me.</p>

<p>“He is alive?” I said, at last.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You must go back to him, some day?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Bernoline, why&mdash;why didn’t you tell me?”</p>

<p>She waited a moment.</p>

<p>“It is not my secret alone. It is terrible that I cannot
tell you any more than that. Yes, yes, I have done
wrong: I have been weak. But don’t you reproach me,
David; that would break my heart!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I don’t reproach you!” I blurted out. “I
don’t know your reasons. I know if you’ve done what
you’ve done, there is a reason, and&mdash;it will always be
right. Never, dear, could I have any other feeling
towards you but of reverence for the loveliest and purest
thing I have known.”</p>

<p>“You can still think so, David?” she cried with a little
sob.</p>

<p>“Always. Nothing that you or I can do will ever
change that&mdash;and nothing that has gone before.”</p>

<p>She looked up at me so swiftly, with her sad, sweet
smile, that before I knew it she was in my arms, trembling
against my heart, her head buried against my shoulder.
I knew nothing more, what I did or said, only this:
that we were united&mdash;that this soft, gentle body in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
arms was the woman who, whatever intervened, loved
me now and irrevocably.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ah, mon bien aimé&mdash;ayez de la force pour moi&mdash;je
n’en peux plus&mdash;non&mdash;non&mdash;je n’en peux plus!</i>”</p>

<p>But even as she cried to me to be strong for her, she
clung to me, her arms strained about me, and her body
collapsed in my grip.</p>

<p>“Bernoline, look into my eyes, dear!”</p>

<p>She raised her head, her eyes met mine, all struggling
at an end. Another moment, and our impending lips
would have closed in the first kiss. Yet, by some inexplicable
miracle, it was I who was the stronger. For
what I saw in her dear eyes was so innocent and so full
of trust that I could not tarnish the ideal. My arms
loosed and slowly I put her from me.</p>

<p>She caught her breath, and her hands went to my
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are as I knew you were,” she said proudly.
“Never shall I forget, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">David mon ami, mon ami adoré</i>.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” I said, drawing a deep breath.</p>

<p>“And now, believe me, a last time&mdash;if I could&mdash;if
I only had the right to say what you want to hear, how
gladly my heart would go to you! But David, I can
say this: in all my life, I have never for one instant loved
any other man&mdash;and I never will. That is a promise.”</p>

<p>“Bernoline, I have done everything as you wished,
more than I would have believed I could do. This I ask:
during those months of loneliness and trial, write to me,
and let me write to you!”</p>

<p>“Is that wise, I wonder?” she said, yet already wishing
to be convinced.</p>

<p>“You cannot leave me utterly. I am not strong
enough for that! Anything else&mdash;but not that!”</p>

<p>“Nor I.” Her eyes filled with tears and then, at last,
through the tears, the smile came bravely forth. “Until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
the end of the war, then. And now&mdash;” She stopped,
looked at me, and shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>“So soon?”</p>

<p>“It is best not to try ourselves beyond our strength,”
she said. “But&mdash;we will not go too fast.”</p>

<p>I do not remember much what she said. For I was
silent, once the great test passed, all at once weak and
rebellious. She spoke to me, recalling our first meeting,
speaking of the home she had found. My head was turning.
All the complications, all the tragic incidents of our
meeting and parting, the fatality that lay between us;
all was nothing to the knowledge of the love that had
looked at me out of the great dark eyes. My instincts
revolted. I could not believe, I would not believe that
this was the end. Somewhere, somehow, the future would
be ours, if we had to wait&mdash;for twenty years!</p>

<p>We came to the end and, as I stood, all choked up, she
took my hand and laid it against her heart&mdash;a moment.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon ami</i>, you will be there, always.”</p>

<p>The light in her eyes is still before me as I write and
the dear face, transformed with all the pure happiness
of a child.</p>

<p>“And now&mdash;” she began reluctantly.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no! Not that word!” I blurted out.</p>

<p>“As you wish,” she said gravely. “Courage, and God
keep you, my dear.”</p>

<p>She went up the steps slowly, looking back, and her
eyes for a moment lingered, smiling down on me, before
she could find courage to end a look that might be the
last. The door closed and shut her out from me.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>And from these moments, sanctified in my memory, by
the perverse turns of my fate, that seems to entangle all
the skeins of my life, the good and the evil, I came back
to meet&mdash;Letty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>She was in the salon that separated our rooms when
I entered, and from the look on Ben’s face I saw that
his soul was being torn to its foundations. At my entrance
they stopped, in a sudden telltale silence.</p>

<p>“You here, Letty?” I said, stupidly enough. God
knows that no more unwelcome figure could have come
before me at that moment.</p>

<p>She nodded curtly, but did not speak. She looked
quite worn despite her artifice, and in her cold face the
eyes burned forth as they did only when she was roused
to some fury of obstinate determination. The conversation
had been at a high tension, as I could see by Ben’s
ugly frown. I went into my bedroom and closed the
door and, overcome by the moral nausea of this malignant
intrusion across the clean memory of the evening’s
exaltation, I sank on the bed and, taking my head in my
hands, cursed her from the bitterness of my heart as I
have never cursed another human being.</p>

<p>Not that she had come to see me. I knew too well
the only genuine impulse of which in her tired experience
she was capable. It was only the prey which was escaping
her that could rouse the female in her. I did not
know how far Ben had gone in his revolt,&mdash;though I
suspected that he had given an ultimatum. But I knew
this, that Letty would never let him go without a struggle.
What to do? My lips were sealed: the slightest false
move might precipitate a tragedy. An hour passed,
while I listened to the falling and rise of their contending
voices, when, suddenly, the door opened and banged, and
Ben came into the room.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, David, get her away!”</p>

<p>I sprang up, half expecting Letty to rush in&mdash;but she
did not&mdash;and after a moment I went over to my brother
and laid my hand on his shoulder to steady him.</p>

<p>“Ben, do you mean that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>“Get her away&mdash;quick!”</p>

<p>“That’s a big responsibility to take,” I said slowly.
“Your mind’s made up?”</p>

<p>He dug his fingers into his arms and, in the breath that
went through him, I felt a sudden vacillation.</p>

<p>“Ben,” I said, sternly. “Stick to your guns. Care
for you? All she cares is to know she can make you
suffer. Sit down.”</p>

<p>I went on tiptoe to the door and flung it open. As I
had known, she was there, listening. But it is dangerous
to try such a woman as Letty too far, and the blind rage
I saw in her face at this exposure so frightened me that,
closing the door behind me, I clapped my hand over
her mouth and picked her up bodily.</p>

<p>“The scene is over, and out you go,” I said, savagely.
She did not struggle but suddenly became quiet and inert
and, with the devilish instinct that was in her to wound
me, her arms closed softly about my neck. I wrenched
myself free, loathing the hated perfume of her body, and
set her down in the hall.</p>

<p>“So, you have told him?” she said quickly, keen for
the pretense at dramatics.</p>

<p>“If I had, you wouldn’t be alive now,” I said, and
closed and locked the door and, for further security,
slipped the key into my pocket.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It is four o’clock in the morning now, as I finish these
lines. I can hear Ben in the next room, walking up and
down.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>XI</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>At Sea</i></p>

<p>We sailed at noon. Molly and Anne were on the deck
to see us off,&mdash;Letty, to plant a final sting. Anne came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
in after breakfast with her father and with Molly we
went down to the boat. I do not know when I have been
so sorry for any one as for Anne. What fatality ever impelled
her to come into my life at just that moment? She
came in so happily that immediately my heart fell, for
I saw that our last interview in Littledale had left the
way to the future open to her. Yet she had not been
ten minutes with me before her woman’s intuitions had
warned her. I saw the light manner change to a sudden
meditation and always when I turned my head her eyes
were on me in anxious interrogation. Poor child&mdash;I
would have spared her the pain, but it was not to be.
The moment we were left alone together on the dark
and pungent wharf, she turned to me and said:</p>

<p>“David, you have seen her?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>I took her arm and led her a little apart, to a nook
where we were hidden from the crowd.</p>

<p>“Anne, for God’s sake, put me out of your life,” I
said, taking her hand. “There is only misery and unhappiness
if you don’t. This is honest, because I must be
honest with you.”</p>

<p>“I can’t put you out of my life,” she said, shaking her
head, “and if you are unhappy&mdash;all the more reason for
me to stay in yours.”</p>

<p>“Anne, it is not fair to you, to what your life may
be.”</p>

<p>“Let me be the judge of that, David,” she said soberly,
her hand on my arm. “Have I the right to know this?
Is it&mdash;the other&mdash;still quite hopeless?”</p>

<p>“Quite,” I said gloomily.</p>

<p>“David, my heart goes out to you. If I could only help.
No, no&mdash;Wait a moment, I can’t go back yet.”</p>

<p>“All right now?”</p>

<p>“All right, David.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<p>And when we went back, there was Letty, her arm
through Molly’s, as pretty and as enticing as could be,
coquetting with Mr. Brinsmade. From her face one
would never have had the slightest suspicion that there
was the least flaw in the serene content of her day. I
held myself on my guard, fearing her purpose, but at
the last she caught me as, of course, she had intended.
The whistle blew and with it the time to say good-by.
Molly, little trump, held up with forced gayety and so
did Anne, though I saw such suffering in her eyes that it
was all I could do not to take her impulsively in my arms:
for, no matter what I had protested for her sake, to know
that she cared was a great consolation.</p>

<p>When it came Letty’s turn, quite as the most natural
thing in the world (as, of course, to the others it was),
she flung her arms about me and kissed me; there&mdash;before
Ben. Then she went off, protesting it was bad
luck to see a ship out of port, thoroughly pleased with
having planted a last dart. And Ben and I, with that
kiss between us, went up the gangway.</p>

<p>“I hope to God I never lay eyes on her again!” he
said, with an oath.</p>

<p>If only that may be true!</p>

<p>We went to the promenade deck and stood over the
stern, gazing back at the shores that began to recede. The
waters rushed in between the wharf and us. I saw Molly
and Anne in the crowd and raised my hat, swinging it
slowly back and forth. And as I looked into that fading
throng, my heart leaped a little at the thought that perhaps
she, Bernoline, might be standing there, come down
for a last look&mdash;a quite irrational thought&mdash;yet I did
feel her there, in that human mass, unrecognizable, now
nothing more than a spotted shadow against the pier.
Then the pier ran back into the oblivion of the city and
the city faded into the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<p>I do not remember since boyhood to have felt the
utter empty loneliness of life as at that moment. But a
few months before I had been self-sufficient, a curious
traveler, emerging from one experience, eager for others,
satisfied and interested with the contact of my kind.
Now, for what had come into my life in one short week,
for an hour in the twilight, for a look given and taken,
a voice remembered, I felt at once rudely lifted out of
the companionship of men, doomed to carry with me a
solitude from which there could be no escape.</p>

<p>In this weakness of the spirit I even rebelled against
the call which took me back; the inexorable call of duty
and honor which, after all, is only our yielding to what
others may think of us: at least, in this moment of rebellion,
this is what I feel! For, now that life has
grown so precious to me, even though I but cling to ashes
of hope, I wonder how in the coming days of battle I
shall stand the test? Yet now that I write with a
clearer discipline, a new feeling of reverence comes to me
as I think on the men of France who fought beside me,
with memories and hopes in their hearts. What others
have done, I can do. All our vaunted courage is sometimes
no more than that.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>New York was but a haze in the distance as I stood by
my brother’s side, with the dread feeling of the irrevocable
in life closing down on me, wondering when&mdash;where&mdash;and
how, again?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>As we stood there, a cabin boy hailed us: “Mr. Littledale?
Special delivery for you, sir.”</p>

<p>We both turned hastily.</p>

<p>“Which Mr. Littledale?”</p>

<p>“David Littledale, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. It’s for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<p>I took the letter and at the first glance, though I had
never seen her handwriting, I knew it was from Bernoline.</p>

<p>“David?”</p>

<p>Ben’s hand closed over my wrist, and I looked up to see
his eyes ablaze with jealousy and suspicion.</p>

<p>“David, show me that letter!”</p>

<p>I held it before him, and he gave it one wild look and
turned away.</p>

<p>“Ben, old fellow, get hold of yourself!”</p>

<p>“I feel like jumping over and swimming for it,” he
said miserably.</p>

<p>“To-morrow you’ll be thanking God from the bottom
of your heart,” I said, linking my arm under his. “Do
you remember once when you came between me and
making a fool of myself, and how we fought and rolled
on the ground? Well, my turn, now. It’s a queer world,
and we’ve both got to grin and bear things. But it
isn’t a question of love, Ben. It’s just been slavery,
weak, unnatural, humiliating slavery. Better now than
later!”</p>

<p>“Right! Sorry I made such an ass of myself. It’s
over, and, David, that’s the last I’ll ever see of her.”</p>

<p>But I am not so sure of that.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The letter was crumpled in my hand. To have given
courage to Ben gave me a sort of courage, which I sadly
needed. I did not at once open and read it. I was
afraid. I was afraid of a hundred nameless imagined
fears, but most of all of the sure reaction I knew must
come in her woman’s heart, once the irresistible spell of
our coming together had been broken. I went below,
into the saloon, and laid her letter before me on the desk.
Then, with a sudden inspiration, I found a sheet of
paper and wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<i>Sailing down the Harbor</i></p>

<p class="in0">Bernoline, dear:</p>

<p>Your letter is here, before my eyes: and I am still afraid to
open it. I shall not read it until I have written this. For
I feel already what you will say. Bernoline, no matter what
the obstacle which stands between us, it can alter nothing.
While you live and I live, we are powerless to change what
fate has laid upon us. As for me, just to know your love is
to me so great a thing that if I had to choose again with open
eyes, I would choose all I have suffered and all that may come
to me, all the heart-burnings and all the daily, hourly longing,
the cruelty of separation,&mdash;all just to have seen your eyes
at parting. Be to each other what is right that we should be,&mdash;the
rest is beyond our knowledge. I have strength for
everything but one thing,&mdash;not to hear from you again.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">David.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Then I took up her letter, and read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright"><i>Midnight</i></p>

<p class="in0"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon seul ami</i>:</p>

<p>I have prayed on my knees for hours to see my
way clear. For I no longer know myself. I, who thought
myself so strong, have had so little strength. All that I have
determined not to do, I have done. And yet, when you were
at my side I could not do otherwise. When you are near me
all my courage leaves me and I do not know what I do or
say. And it is I who am so much older than you in experience
and suffering who ought to protect you. But you,&mdash;is
it not your whole life I am wrecking? Would it not be better
to have you hate me than to do what I am doing? Is it not
a great crime I am committing? For David, my dear David,&mdash;it
<i>cannot</i> be. There is no hope for us, now, or ever. What
shall I do? To-night, my heart is torn&mdash;I cannot think. I
have given my promise, and yet&mdash;Oh, David, I want to do
what is best for you, and what seems cruel now may be the
kindest later. I cannot decide. What shall I do? Have
courage for us both. Be strong for me.</p>

<p class="sigright">
B.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<p>I read this through once, with heavy heart,&mdash;then
many times. To give her up was beyond my strength,
though something within me admitted the truth of what
she wrote. I took up my letter again, and added this
postscript:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>P. S.&mdash;I have read your letter, and I would not change
a word of this. You leave the decision to me. I make it, and
I take on my shoulders all that may come. I cannot do
otherwise. I need your strength. I shall always need it.
The fate that has sent us to each other is more mysterious
than our little reason can fathom. Yet in it there must be
some purpose. We can never harm each other. One thing is
life; the other, worse than death. Write to me, dear little
friend. Give me only what it is right for you to give me. I
shall ask no more.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">David.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>I put the letter into the bag myself and watched the
pilot go over the side of the ship. Then, I went down to
my cabin and got out my <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu’s</i> uniform. Another milestone
passed.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="PART_IV" id="PART_IV"></a>PART IV</h2>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>I</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>Paris</i></p>

<p>Some mysterious influence seems to be watching over
me; perhaps Mr. Brinsmade, for his hand is powerful
here, and a request from him would undoubtedly be honored.
At any rate, on my return I found orders for
me to report temporarily at the Bureau de la Presse as
an interpreter. At any other time I should resent this,
but now&mdash;frankly&mdash;I am glad, as I want to be able
to transfer into the American service as soon as we declare
war, and to be in Paris is to be where friends and
influence can expedite matters. Ben goes into the Morgan-Harjes
ambulance for six months, and leaves at the
end of the week. He is more taciturn than ever, but the
feeling of being in a great current, a man among men, is,
I know, a great release to him. We have never discussed
Letty since the day of our departure, when he gave
me to understand that the separation was definite. I am
still in the dark as to his real thoughts. Sometimes, I
catch his glance on mine (quickly averted) and I wonder.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The coming back to it all, much to my surprise, was
the most natural thing in the world. I felt no special
thrill, no strangeness and (this surprised me) not the
slightest revolt. In some ways it was a relief from my
thoughts, from my own little existence battling against
the currents of destiny.</p>

<p>Yet I except one moment,&mdash;the day of our landing
at Bordeaux, when the shifting turns of my destiny were
brought before me in a dramatic revelation. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
at the rail, looking down on the tedious process of the
tying up to the dock. A number of blue-gray recruits
were straggling out of wine shops, lounging on the piers,
watching our arrival. Suddenly, at the call of a bugle,
the gray, loosely flung shadows contracted, took shape
and alignment, became an entity. Another command
and a hundred feet swung forward, a hundred arms
rippled over one body, and an idea set to purpose passed
up the street. A moment before they were identities, free
as I still was; free to turn, to sit, to rise, to jump and to
run; the next, all human semblance had sunk into the
anonymity of a machine. It was glorious. It stirred
me as nothing else has the power to stir the blood,&mdash;this
groping become an idea, this confusion crystallizing into
purpose, this visualization of man moving as history
moves. Yet for that moment it terrified me with its
actuality. For I felt the obliteration of all that had
been for these last incredible weeks&mdash;David Littledale.
Anonymity? Yes, as death may be anonymous, and
number me into the ranks of the forgotten.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>At Bordeaux, I bade Ben good-by and became once
more Brigadier Littledale, Légion Etrangère, soldier of
France. It is the dirt and the filth that are hard to
accept,&mdash;the feeling of being of the cattle of war.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>From there to Paris, in a steaming mass of human
flesh, crowded into box cars. No longer the swinging
enthusiasm of the mobilization; instead a comradeship
become the ox-like acceptance of a fate which has fatigued
the imagination into indifference. But the return
is always hideous. At Paris, to the medical inspection,
and the surprise of being detached and transferred. Perhaps
the imminence of our entry into the war, which can
be but a matter of days, is much in my good fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>My new detail gives me quite a little liberty, as some
of my superiors are old friends of social days, and I am
permitted to sleep at the hotel with Ben, who was astonished
when I walked in. To-morrow we are going over
to see Alan. I am a little apprehensive of how he will
receive Ben. No letter yet from Bernoline. I write her
each night and mail the letter at the end of the week.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Dined to-night with Ben at an out-of-the-way restaurant
of older days, across the Seine, where boys of thirteen
and fourteen masqueraded as waiters and gave us of
the toll of death. My old <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sommelier</i>, who always kept a
special bottle for me (or made me think he did), is gone,
dead in the fight around the Labyrinth. New faces everywhere.
Afterwards we walked back, silently, across the
blackened city, stumbling down old Paris towards the
dim blur of a hooded light. Occasionally a star detached
itself from the Milky Way and went wandering like a
great firefly, where above us, a sentinel aeroplane patrolled
the night.</p>

<p>We came back shoulder to shoulder, unseen to each
other, in long stretches of silence. It is strange how
little we can say to each other. I have not the slightest
inkling to the ways of his mind. Sometimes I think him
totally devoid of imagination. Perhaps I am wrong
and in his inner shell his thoughts are active and relentless.
His code is a strange one&mdash;very Anglo-Saxon&mdash;and
I think he is still ashamed that once or twice I saw
him in the raw. I of course never refer to Letty, though
her presence is always between us. The nearest approach
to intimacy is a dialogue like this:</p>

<p>“How are you to-day, Ben?”</p>

<p>“First rate.”</p>

<p>“Nothing worrying you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>“You look more like your old self.”</p>

<p>“Feel so.”</p>

<p>“All right then, old fellow?”</p>

<p>“Quite.”</p>

<p>And we are two human beings, brothers even, living
from day to day and indifferent to the fates!</p>

<p>Whether the passion in him that Letty had fired has
died out or is only smoldering, I have no way of knowing.
I am inclined to think it is his pride that suffers
most. I do not think there is any black resolve back of
his mind. His imagination is not apt to run away with
him. But, having written this, I wonder. He is a
nature utterly incomprehensible to me, and daily contact
seems to send him further away. I am living with
a stranger.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>II</h3>

<p>This afternoon we saw Alan. I had sent him word of
our arrival at Bordeaux, before I knew I should have the
opportunity to see him. As a matter of fact, I was apprehensive
of what might happen, for both Alan and Ben
are strong-willed and direct to the point. But to my surprise
the meeting passed off without incident. We sat
down as though twenty years had not passed and the
leader was not Alan nor myself, but Ben. We both felt
it. From the moment he walked into the room, he was
the older brother and tradition held.</p>

<p>It was a curious phenomenon, yet one that I have noticed
before on meeting again some hero of school days;
an idolatry does abide that nothing in the passage of
human life can destroy. It is probably this reason&mdash;the
need of revolting against a mastership once acknowledged&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
drives certain strong growing natures away from
the dwarfing influences of the family.</p>

<p>Alan was alone when we entered, though Toinon came
in shortly afterward.</p>

<p>“Well, Skipper, pretty banged up, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Ben had come in with outstretched hand, as though
there had never been a cloud between them, and Alan,
who had hung back at my first approach, found himself
shaking hands, yielding, allowing himself to be ordered
around by the man against whom he had steeled his heart.</p>

<p>“Well, how are you? You look pretty much slapped
around but a damned sight better than I expected.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Much better.”</p>

<p>“Amazingly so, old fellow. You’ll be out having a
fling at the Boche before you know it.”</p>

<p>And he did look better, though how much may have
been the excitement of seeing us is a thing I do not know.</p>

<p>“Here. Stretch out in this chair. If there’s any
hustling to do, we’ll do it. Coddle yourself there. Davy
and I can find the tobacco. Nice diggings you have
here.”</p>

<p>At this moment Toinon came in, her market basket on
her arm, and stopped short at sight of us.</p>

<p>“What shall I call her? Davy has told me about her,”
said Ben, rising.</p>

<p>“Toinon&mdash;Mademoiselle Toinon, if you like. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Toinon,
ma mie, c’est mon frère Ben. Tu connais David. Viens
ici.</i>”</p>

<p>She shook hands gaily, and passing to Alan, leaned
over and kissed him, while Alan looked at us with a certain
defiance.</p>

<p>“Don’t carry a chip on your shoulder, Skipper,” said
Ben, knocking out the ashes from his pipe, while Toinon
disappeared with her marketing.</p>

<p>“And if I married her?” said Alan stubbornly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span></p>

<p>“Why? If you’re happy,” said Ben, shrugging his
shoulders, “I’m sure that’s your affair. And I say, Skipper&mdash;we’re
grown up, so let’s quit scrapping.” He sat down
and stretched himself before the little wood fire and began
to laugh.</p>

<p>“What’s so funny?” said Alan suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Guess Davy can figure it out.”</p>

<p>He grew suddenly solemn and laid his hand on my arm.</p>

<p>“Sometime, when I’m not around, you can tell him&mdash;you
would, anyhow. Fact, Alan, I wasn’t laughing at
you. If you’re good at guessing, that ought to shut you
up. Let’s talk of other things.”</p>

<p>Toinon came and stood warming her ankles at the fire,
looking down on the three of us. From her height she
began to smile, in an amused way.</p>

<p>“You are alike as three ogres,” she said, drawing her
finger over her eyebrows, to indicate the characteristic
Littledale line. “You will lunch with us?”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Y-a de quoi manger, ma petite?</i>”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mais, oui, et du bon vin.</i>”</p>

<p>Alan’s voice was of a gentleness we had never heard.
We offered to run out to a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">charcutier</i>, but he would not
hear of it and realizing that it might be a question of
pride, we did not insist. There was no reason for our
anxiety, for the lunch was delicious and under the mellowing
influence of the extra bottle of wine the stiffness
wore away. Yet the conversation was not exactly expansive.</p>

<p>“What made you get into it, Skipper?”</p>

<p>“More amusing than staying out. How about you?”</p>

<p>“Same with me.”</p>

<p>“Davy said you were going in the ambulance.”</p>

<p>“Just for a couple of months. I’ve been at Plattsburg.
I’ll strike for a commission as soon as we get in it.”</p>

<p>Ben glanced at his watch and jumped up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello! Must be off.” He shook hands punctiliously
with Toinon. “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Déjeuner tres bon.</i> Good-by, Skipper.
Any time I get a chance at Paris I’ll look you up. Are
you fixed all right for money?”</p>

<p>“Plenty.”</p>

<p>“No offense. See you later, Davy.”</p>

<p>He had been over an hour in the apartment, asked
twenty questions, studied everything, and said nothing
at all.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s over,” I said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, damn his cool cheek; but you’re as bad as I am;
we sat there listening to him as though we were both
twelve years old,” he said, in his growling way.</p>

<p>“Habit, Alan. You see, Ben never has two ideas in
his mind. Make a good officer.”</p>

<p>“Probably. What was he hinting at? Domestic difficulties?”</p>

<p>Then I told him, omitting, of course, whatever concerned
me personally.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see why he laughed,” he said, when I had finished.
“That was almost human. Is it possible, I
wonder, that Ben has got a new point of view?”</p>

<p>“He is a clam, you know.”</p>

<p>We had gone back to our chairs before the fireplace.
I saw that Alan was quite puzzled over Ben’s history.</p>

<p>“Thinking of Ben?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Never figured him out that way,” he said meditatively.
“You know, with all the antagonism he roused
in me, I used to envy him his disposition.”</p>

<p>“Envy!”</p>

<p>“Yes; I figured out a fellow like that would go on ambling
through life, getting just about what he wanted from
it, not worried by ideas or having much to struggle with.
Guess I don’t know so much about human nature, after
all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s a law of averages comes in, even with Ben.”</p>

<p>“Suppose so. Did he take it hard?”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“Curious. I always thought of Ben as some robber
baron of the Middle Ages. I’d sort of expect him to rig
up a gallows and see justice done in good old mousquetaire
fashion.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I say, David, why the devil do we feel his leadership
the way we do? We can think all around him.
We’ve gone fifty years ahead of him.”</p>

<p>“Funny. I’ve been puzzling over that, myself.”</p>

<p>“Suppose men of action aren’t necessarily thinkers.
We turn around an idea, see the complexities; a decision
with us is a mental process of elimination. With him,
it is instantaneous&mdash;an instinct; the primitive. That’s
why I’d have thought he’d strangle her.”</p>

<p>“Family feeling counts.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right; felt that as we three were sitting
here; felt it strong. And a year ago I would have laughed
at it. It’s so. I may champ at the bit, but I’m one of
you Littledales, for all that.”</p>

<p>Toinon brought in the coffee, slipped a pillow under
his shoulders, and went back into the kitchen. He looked
very like the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">condottieri</i> of the Middle Ages he described,
as he sat sunk in his chair, the dressing-gown loose on his
thin frame, white bony hands locked under his chin, deep
eyes and stubbled hair, gaunt and relentless.</p>

<p>“Davy, it would be queer if I pulled through, after
all.”</p>

<p>I looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>“Course you’re going to! What an idea! Why, you
took my breath away when I came in&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Honest?”</p>

<p>“Quite honest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>“You know a man like myself shouldn’t fool himself,”
he said, staring into the fire. “To-day’s a good day. But
I do seem to be picking up. You know, I would like to
live. I don’t mind going, not at all. But&mdash;it’s such an
interesting world, I’d like to see what’s going to happen,
and&mdash;after.”</p>

<p>He moved his hand in a feeble gesture, and the shadow
it made crept across the sunlight that flooded the room.</p>

<p>“It’s interesting when you’ve got to an impersonal
point of view and you can stand and just look on. Youth
is a sort of disease. I’ve lived through that fever, groped
beyond my limitations, struggled with nightmares. It
left some marks on me&mdash;not many. Funny, I feel just
ready to begin life, now.”</p>

<p>“I wish to God I could look at it that way,” I said impulsively.</p>

<p>“What way, Davy?” he said, a little puzzled, and by
that I knew that he had been talking, not to me, but to
some shadowy self.</p>

<p>“Looking at things from the impersonal way.”</p>

<p>I was making a pretense of emptying my pipe, and
turning, I faced his sharp eyes.</p>

<p>“Want to talk it out, Davy?”</p>

<p>“Some day, perhaps. Not now.”</p>

<p>“You’re too young yet,” he said, nodding. “You think
in terms of yourself. Most of us do, and philosophy
isn’t going to help that.”</p>

<p>“Right, there.”</p>

<p>“Know what strikes me? We human beings have so
damned little charity towards ourselves. All the institutions
we’ve ever created&mdash;the Church, the State, Society;
for we <i>have</i> created them&mdash;make us despise ourselves,&mdash;look
down upon ourselves. For two thousand
years we’ve got the conception that we are weak, crawling
worms, originally sinful, predestined to evil. We’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
been thundered at, frightened, cursed, and every agency
has united to belittle us in our own eyes. And yet, Davy,
look at the wonder of it; it’s only a few thousand years
since we were among the beasts of the field, groping in
the darkness. And now, we have illuminated the night,
ridden the air, sowed the earth, bridged the sea, abolished
every impossibility, except the one thing&mdash;time. And
it’s not simply brain force, science, but the instinct
towards a beautiful ideal, that’s amazing in us; we’ve
evolved a Parthenon out of placing one stone on top of
another; we’ve blown into a seashell and imagined a
modern orchestra; created literature, painting, the forms
of government, and all in a few thousand years, despite
this strange conception of our impotence and frailty. By
Jove, sometimes I almost want to go and just lift my hat
in reverence to my race!”</p>

<p>“What’s going to happen after this war is over?” I
said, interested in this revelation of Alan.</p>

<p>“Here?”</p>

<p>“Well, I was thinking of America. Been thinking a
lot about it lately. You’ve had the chance to knock about
as I haven’t. What do you think is coming?”</p>

<p>“I’ll answer you like this,” he said, reaching for a
pipe which he held a moment nervously in his teeth,
champing on it as a horse does on its bit. “It’s all complex
till you look at it in just one way. Look at it as you
would the forces of nature. Forces of human nature act
just the same way. That is, if you can see them in the
proper perspective.</p>

<p>“There’s only one genuine aristocracy in the world to-day:
that’s Germany. It is a genuine force, because it
does lead, is educated to lead. England is an aristocracy
that is more or less artificial, struggling to hold the leadership
it has inherited. And, Davy, I’m not so sure that
Germany is going to be beaten.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be damned&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Germany and the German idea are two separate
things. You’ve got to beat her thoroughly if you want
to get rid of the German conception of the State. Just
a stand-off won’t do that. Quite frankly, to me the
tragedy to-day is that the German idea of government,
the finest modern conception, has got to be stamped out
because it is harnessed to this inhuman, bestial, conscienceless
Prussianism. It is economically sound and
morally wrong.”</p>

<p>“Well, Alan, I don’t think I can follow you there,” I
said, warmly. “Perhaps I hate them too much to see any
good in them, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Good? Why, Davy, what are you going to put up
against them? Your other civilizations, based on individualism,
without responsibility, order, discipline, efficiency?
Whatever you may think about it, Germany
has a logical conception, worked out to the minutest detail.
What have we? A government based on the theory
of the consent of the governed. And who governs? Not
the people&mdash;not the leaders we see&mdash;but something
which remains in the shadows. We’re plundered, we’re
wasteful, we’re inefficient; we don’t even know there is
a science of government. Government annoys us. We
conceive of the State as a big telephone central, a convenient
policeman. It isn’t an ideal; it isn’t even a central
idea to express all the future of a great democracy.
Why talk of the State when we can’t govern even a single
city! No other nation in the world could go on like that
without being gobbled up. But we go on because we see
no visible danger. David, I sometimes wonder if it
wouldn’t be better for us if Germany did win,&mdash;just as
it would bring us up short if we had the threat of a great
civilization on our Mexican frontier.”</p>

<p>“I grant that; but what if Germany doesn’t win?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>

<p>“Then it won’t be a question of what we’ve got to do
but one of natural evolution. Let’s go back to forces.
Wherever you find the greatest force concentrating, there
you’ll find the ultimate power. What is a revolution but
the shifting of the balance of power from an artificial
force to a natural force? When the old order falters,
weakens, sickens, it becomes an artificial control; the
leadership is imposed and not genuine, and, you can put
it down as an axiom that an artificial force is a force
whose days are numbered. Society is like an iceberg.
Eight ninths of it are under the surface, but when that
upper minority dwindles below the line of safety, the submerged
mass rises to the sky. We have a new peak but
the balance remains the same. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“I see what you’re driving at,” I admitted reluctantly,
for his method recalled to me the haunting prophecies of
Peter Magnus.</p>

<p>“We’ve had the king idea and the aristocratic idea, and
both theoretically were good ideas so long as you had the
intelligent despot and the class that had the right to lead;
and those ideas were practical ideas, so long as they were
concentrated, unified, and efficient. Decay, before revolution,
destroyed them. Then you’ve had the rise of the
middle class, and remember this in all fairness, Davy,
each class has always ruled in its own interest. Now, in
America what class or force is there that is unified, concentrated
and efficient to carry out its decisions?”</p>

<p>“Labor, and labor alone,” I said, following in his
thought.</p>

<p>“Something greater than agitation has done it. It’s
the course of modern civilization,&mdash;machinery. It began
with the first invention. To-day it is an accelerating
force. Ten thousand cobblers scattered through a State
are not a political force, but ten thousand workers in a
shoe factory are. They live together, they think together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
they become politically conscious. Davy, answer this to
yourself: can you honestly believe there is anything going
to prevent a class that has the power, that knows it has
the power, from finally exercising that power, in the same
way and for the same ends that every other social movement
has acted?”</p>

<p>“No, not as you put it; not as I see it now.”</p>

<p>“Why deceive ourselves? What is the meaning of a
strike? More wages, better conditions? Not fundamentally.
Every strike is one step onward in the solidification
of a new political force,&mdash;a skirmish before the
final battle.”</p>

<p>“Then you, too, think that the old order is passing?”</p>

<p>“Passing! It started the day universal suffrage was
proclaimed. I suppose now you’ll ask me if I believe in
democracy?”</p>

<p>“I confess I am wondering.”</p>

<p>“Ask me if I believe in machinery! Why debate on
what is an accomplished fact? Why ask if a river should
move in its course? If machinery was inevitable, so democracy
was inevitable. We have proclaimed universal
suffrage; now we must watch it work out to its logical
conclusion. We’ve been proclaiming one thing and doing
another for generations. Now, we’re going to find
out.”</p>

<p>“Socialism, then?”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. The rise of a new force; a perfectly
natural appetite for power, that’s all. Ideas are always
translated into appetites. The Girondins were a body of
idealists, and the Revolution they produced immediately
devoured them. As a matter of fact, men in the mass do
not want anything different from men as privileged individuals;
only they want the luxury for themselves, and
when they are strong enough they seize it,&mdash;to live first
and then to enjoy life in a big and bigger way,&mdash;the pursuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
of happiness, if you wish. Just as strong in the mass
as with us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll agree this much, Alan,” I said, “though I know
much of what you’ve said is true: our American failure
has been the failure to produce a continuing class of
leadership. If those who are born to lead, who ought to
be educated to lead, won’t lead, they must take the consequences.
And I’m hitting my own kind!”</p>

<p>“Particularly as others are preparing to take that leadership.”</p>

<p>When I left, I put out a hand with a genuine admiration
and affection.</p>

<p>“Well, Alan, it’s pretty late to be finding it out, isn’t
it, but I’m glad I’ve really got to know you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” he said gruffly, but pleased nevertheless.
“Drop around. Lots more to be settled in the
old world. I say, Davy, I wonder what Ben would have
thought of my heresies?”</p>

<p>We broke into a hearty laugh at this, and I went out.</p>

<p>When I reached the hotel, I sat down and wrote out
a little of the conversation to Bernoline. For I am
anxious to know what she, with every instinct opposed,
will say to it.</p>

<p>“Queer duck, Alan,” said Ben that night at table.
“How long did you stay?”</p>

<p>“About an hour or two.”</p>

<p>“Could you get him to talk?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he opened up quite a bit.”</p>

<p>“Don’t like his dying there, like a dog. We ought to
get him home.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’ll find him rather obstinate.”</p>

<p>“Don’t like it.”</p>

<p>“I think we’d better accept him on his own terms.”</p>

<p>“Don’t like it. Don’t like his dying in a hole. Don’t
like the woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p>“Are we our brother’s keeper?”</p>

<p>“Well, at least, we ought to have a good doctor in.”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of that.”</p>

<p>I arranged for Doctor Murchison, a man I knew at
Neuilly, to go over and make a thorough examination,
cautioning him about dispelling illusions. His report, as
I feared, leaves little hope; the lungs are badly affected.
It can be only a question of time.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>III</h3>

<p>At last her letter! It was waiting for me on the little
table in the hall, among the mail from home. I went up
the stairs breathlessly, without waiting for the elevator,
and shutting myself in, read it again and again.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon ami</i>:</p>

<p>I have waited a whole week since receiving your letter, for
I wanted time to think, to think calmly and deliberately. It
was wrong for me to leave the decision to you, as I did. I
alone must bear the responsibility, for I alone know all the
facts, don’t you see? I shall write you, as I promised, and as
my heart would have it,&mdash;until God brings you safely through
this war.</p>

<p>David, I do this with many misgivings, and my doubts
will always be with me. If, some later day, in your spirit, you
may reproach me and wonder at my lack of courage (some
day, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>, you will do so, and that will be my punishment)
remember this, that I should never have weakened as I have
done, if it were not that you are going again into this hideous
war. All that I have told myself this long week, all my arguments,
are as nothing when I say to myself that death will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
your companion by day and by night. Even if some day you
should blame me in the bitterness of your heart, I can do
no otherwise,&mdash;no woman could. I do not matter,&mdash;you
ask for my strength. It is yours.</p>

<p>And now, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>, only one thing can justify the decision
I have made, freely and not impulsively; the feeling that if
God in some mysterious way has willed that I should come
into your life, that it is not to weaken you, not to sadden you,
but to give you strength and courage and that for knowing
all the faith I have in you, you will rise to the big things.</p>

<p>I have such a high ideal for you, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>. I know your
strength and I know what you need. I feel about you a
certain weakness&mdash;perhaps weakness is too strong a word&mdash;a
certain longing for what a woman, a real woman, can give
to you. You do not speak what is in your heart easily,&mdash;never
to friends. It is through another that you will discover
yourself. Some men are sufficient to themselves and, if they
do not know the greatest happiness&mdash;for women seldom love
them&mdash;they are saved from much sorrow. You are not like
that, David. You are sensitive to every impression and you
need happiness really to find all the qualities of the heart
that are waiting to be called forth. I could not bear the
thought of your marrying the wrong woman.</p>

<p>For you are not meant to go through this world alone. It
may seem strange, incomprehensible to you, that I can hold
you so dear and yet look forward with such hope to your marrying
some lovely young girl, like Anne Brinsmade, to complete
your life. Yet it is so. It is the maternal in me, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon
ami</i>, that you always appeal to, David, since I have no right
to the other. Let me then be in your life all that means hope
and faith and ambition, during this period of trial, and if you
wish to make me feel some little happiness in what I do, let
me know that nothing I have done will ever weaken your
courage or prevent your seeking the happiness to which every
man has a right. Let us keep then a nobility of spirit, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon
ami</i>, and without rebellion or sadness, face life as God in his
fuller knowledge has willed to prove us.</p>

<p class="sigright">
B.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span></p>

<p>When I had read this through the first time&mdash;tumultuously&mdash;seeking
to absorb it in one breath, I read it
through again, slowly, stopping at every sentence, sometimes
with every sense thrilling, sometimes with a black
revolt against the obstinate struggle for a repression that
I knew was not in her heart. I searched every phrase for
a significance that might be concealed beneath the words,
alternately high with hope and again given over to despair.
When I had read her letter for the fifth time, I
laid it on my lap and abandoned myself to my thoughts.
It had become so dark in my little bedroom that I could
no longer distinguish her handwriting. Outside, over
the young green of the trees, past the fading foliage of
the Champs Elysées, the golden dome of the Invalides
was paling in the sifting in of the dust. It is the hour
of all the day to which I am most sensitive, the hour,
when shared, which brings a tenderness to the heart that
raises us triumphant above the riot of the city, but an
hour, when faced alone, that oppresses the imagination
and weighs it down with the futility of hoping against
the inevitable, when memories of vanished happiness are
too acute and separation intolerable.</p>

<p>I rose hurriedly, lit my candle and drew the curtains.
How many emotions thronged into my heart as I sat
down at my table and turned her letter in my hands; the
soft blue paper, with the thin and rounded handwriting,
that was all Bernoline,&mdash;order, discipline and delicacy.
My first impulse was to take up the chronicle of my days
and write to her while the mood was strong. I remained
an hour staring at an empty page, unable to phrase a
thought. And, even now, what is in my mind? There
are moments when I face the truth without wavering, and
tell myself that her instinct is right, that there is no outcome
possible for me, that I am wilfully, blindly plunging
ahead into an entanglement which will wreck my whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
life; that I am wrong in overcoming her determination
and forcing a situation which is against her intuitions,&mdash;and
where, of course, she must suffer as much as I shall.
For in her tradition there is no escape even from the most
hideous of marriages.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The idea of her being married is unbearable to me, and
I revolt against the inhumanity and immorality of such
enforced slavery. At the thought of her sensitive, fragile
spirit at the brutal whim of a husband she loathed&mdash;No,
I cannot bear to dwell on what may have happened:
thank God, her body, at least, is now free. Perhaps that
is the explanation of her anonymity and her terror of retaining
even a trace of her past identity.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>As I write, an extraordinary thought flashes into my
mind,&mdash;extraordinary because, strangely enough, it has
never occurred to me before; are there children in her
life, too? I remember, now, how she shrank from the
touch of Master Jack that morning on the boat when we
told fairy tales. Can it be possible? And why has such
a supposition never occurred to me before? And yet&mdash;no&mdash;I
do not think this possible. It is possible that
there may have been a child, but not that there is a
child that is living to-day; no, that is quite unthinkable!
For with her faith, her clear sense of duty, her acceptance
of sacrifice,&mdash;no, that is impossible, quite impossible!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>At least there is this consolation to me, sitting here
alone and separated by time and distance; I know how
profoundly her heart has gone out to me; that despite
all her traditions, she has been unable to close the door
and put me out of her life. Whatever the waiting, to
know that is to have something to cling to. Who knows?
This war in which my own life must be risked, may free
us both!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span></p>

<p>Now that I can think more sanely, and that every word
of hers is written in my memory, thank God that there
is only one feeling in my heart, and that for her. What
am I to pit my sorrows against hers? I shall do as she
asks of me. No written word of mine shall ever cause
her a regret or a pain, if I can help it. And that will not
be easy, for it means a constant struggle, a constant check
on every impulse.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>After all, are not my little reasonings quite futile?
What must be, will be. We have ventured unwittingly
from the safe shallows into the great tumult of life and
destiny, and it will bear us where it wills. So, why debate
and wonder?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In the same mail came a letter from Anne. Only a few
pitiful words,&mdash;but reading them has broken me all up:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is not a letter, David: just a message. I am so sorry.
If I could only make it easier to bear. Bless you.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Anne</span>.

<p>At last! Yesterday America declared war. It is my
fight now. I shall be transferred, at once.</p>

<p>I went over to Alan’s in the afternoon and found him
in a high pitch of excitement, insisting on going out to
see the city. I argued with him, fruitlessly, for he
would have his way. So we bundled him up, and Toinon
and I helped him down the stairs, and, with him between
us in the back seat of a lazy fiacre, we went forth into the
delirious city. Flags everywhere, and everywhere, thank
God, the Stars and Stripes! Where they came from,
heaven knows: they blossomed out like dandelions after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
a rain, in the most unexpected places,&mdash;orthodox and
home-made; flags constructed of hastily-ripped-up skirts
and comforters, the stripes and stars confused: but what
did it matter! I think all the crowded panoply of the
boulevards did not give us half the thrill that we received
at the sight of one clumsy, grotesque banner
swinging above a butcher shop on the Rue des Quatre-vents,
with its green-blue stripes and its wabbly white
stars hastily sewn on. Alan was in uniform and I in my
blue-gray, and everywhere it was:</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bravo, les Americains</i>!”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive l’Amerique</i>!”</p>

<p>We stayed out until dark: nothing could induce him
to return sooner.</p>

<p>“Why, good Lord, Davy, this is doing me more good
than all the doctors in Paris,” he exclaimed fretfully.
“This is something to live for. I’ll be cured and back in
a couple of months. You’ll see. You must apply for a
commission for me. I know more about artillery than
half their dinky West Pointers. I can start in a little light
work; there’ll be a lot of instructing necessary. What
do they say? Will the army be sent over here to train?”</p>

<p>I humored him, hoping against hope that the mental
incentive might produce the miracle. But, once before
the test of the long stairs to be climbed, the inexorable
force of reality dispelled our hasty illusions. We helped
him as best we could up four flights, and up the last,
without resistance from him, I carried my brother in
my arms. He had a dreadful spell of coughing that left
him shaken and limp, and for the first time, I believe,
he guessed the truth.</p>

<p>For when we had him at last in bed, and it was time
for me to go, he caught my hand, and cried rebelliously:</p>

<p>“Good God; I haven’t got to die now, have I?”</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>June, At the Front</i></p>

<p>I am back in active service at last. Lieutenant Littledale,
attached as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">officier de liaison</i> with the &mdash;&mdash;th Division
de Fer, French Army, thanks to De Saint Omer,
now Commandant on the staff of General La Pierre.
We are constantly together. My record was against me&mdash;the
leg still has a limp and I am under weight&mdash;and
the best I could have hoped for was to be used in a training
school. So, when De Saint Omer suggested being attached
to the French, I jumped at the chance.</p>

<p>Hope is running high: a new offensive is in the air.
Several American officers have come to us on a visit, and
the stories they bring of preparations at home are very
heartening. The presence of the American uniform works
miracles among the troops.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Letters are fearfully delayed. I have a helpless feeling
that half of them never reach me. It has been a
month since I have had word from Bernoline. The last
news was that she had gone as companion in the family
of the Barristers. It gave me a strange feeling. I know
them; they are cousins of Anne’s, and I am happy that
she at least is with friends. Anne has written me every
week. Ben is in the aviation.</p>

<p class="sigright"><i>A week later</i></p>

<p>To-day Maurice de Saint Omer told me of the death of
his brother in the early days of the war. He was a young
lieutenant, just twenty-two, and was in command of a
section that was to go over the top at dawn.</p>

<p>It was in the early days of the stabilized war of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
trenches, when men went to certain slaughter on account
of the lack of proper artillery protection, and when to
win a few strategic yards, hundreds of men had to be
sacrificed as a screen.</p>

<p>The section of trench which the young lieutenant held
was absolutely at the mercy of the Boche machine guns.
To obey the order meant the death of every man who
went over the top. He debated his duty all through the
night and in the morning, half an hour before the appointed
time, he called his men together and said:</p>

<p>“The attack is to be general, all up and down the line.
Therefore, no account can be taken of local conditions.
You can understand that. There can be no army without
obedience and discipline. But I cannot find it in my heart
to sacrifice every life here. Therefore, at the hour, I go
over the top alone.”</p>

<p>They pleaded with him, but he remained firm as he
saw his duty; wrote his farewell to his brother, embraced
his men, and, when the time came, went over the top, and&mdash;was
killed instantly.</p>

<p>“It is a story to be told after the war,” said De Saint
Omer, in conclusion. “Technically, of course, he was
wrong&mdash;but it was like the boy to pay the price!”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>He told it without emotion that I could see. In fact,
all personal feeling has left him completely. The old
feeling of family and race gives him an impassivity and
a detachment of sacrifice which is beyond my understanding.
No one would recognize now the dandy of
Paris. His hair is gray, his face gaunt and wrinkled, but
he never loses either his faith in the outcome or the Gallic
quality of gaiety to the end. Yet, when he makes a decision,
nothing can swerve him. He hates the Boches with
a burning, unholy hatred (there is some tragic story about
his family and particularly his mother which some day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
I think he will tell me), and yet, when it is a question of
some captured officer, he is punctilious to the extreme in
his courtesy. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Noblesse oblige!</i></p>

<p class="sigright"><i>July</i></p>

<p>Back from the Chemin des Dames affair to hear of
my father’s death in the month of May. I have, of
course, expected it from day to day. Yet now that it has
come, it brings home to me what will some day come to
me, as nothing else has done. Then, too, I have the feeling
of suddenly stepping into the front rank and looking
into vacancy&mdash;a feeling of others crowding at my back&mdash;and
I ask myself, incredulously, if thirty years is now
my allotted span. Strangely enough, I don’t think of
what may happen here.</p>

<p class="sigright"><i>July, In Rest Camp</i></p>

<p>Letters from home; from Anne, Molly and two from
Bernoline. I had almost forgotten the existence of that
other world: not its existence, but its power to reach out
to me. The Champagne offensive has been a ghastly
failure, terrible blunders committed, useless sacrifices.
We all feel it and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilus</i>, too, are not deceived. At
the close of a brave, gossipy letter of Bernoline’s about
the war frenzy at home, a passage that I have read over
three times,&mdash;one that I do not comprehend.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When you write me, David, that you can never think of
me but as a woman to whom every good act is instinctive,&mdash;how
sadly you misjudge me. David, this very ideal you have
of me makes me examine my conscience so restlessly. Don’t
idealize me. See me as I am,&mdash;a very human and weak
woman, who falls far short of the ideal you raise of her. No,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>, the way is not clear before me, nor do I know yet
what I shall do. If you knew how I am tortured by remorse
at times, I who write to you of duty and sacrifice,&mdash;who am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
I to preach to you! I try to say to myself that whatever God
has sent to me in this world, it is His will, as He sees the good
of my soul. If He tries me, it is for His purpose. And yet,
with all my struggling, I do not accept it. I cannot; God have
pity on me!</p>

<p>It is hard to know the right, when others are involved. I
should not write down this moment of weakness, when all
I should mean to you is courage and fortitude. David, if you
ever pray, pray for me in these coming months. Would
that I could open my heart to you.</p>

<p class="sigright">
B.
</p>

<p>What a terrible disaster it has been in Champagne. And
you have been in it! Your last letter spoke of your being
attached to General La Pierre’s staff. I have had you in my
thoughts every moment.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is the first time she has written me so. I am quite
puzzled. What can such a clear, direct nature know of
remorse?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Ben was killed at the front on the eighth of July. He
brought down an enemy plane and fell into a trap. His
machine came down in flames, near X&mdash;&mdash;. We were
not thirty miles away.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Did he do it deliberately, or not? I shall probably
never know for, if he did, he would never leave a hint
of it. Yet I do not think he deliberately threw his life
away. It was not his way of playing the game. Letty
is in Paris. I shall have to see her.</p>

<p>I wonder if Ben left a letter behind him and if that
letter will tell me what I dread to know at the last.</p>

<p>It is hard to write. I can only jot down a few incoherent
notes. Actuality dominates and oppresses me. I
have again the old feeling of having surrendered my
imagination and of moving like an automaton.</p>

<p class="sigright"><i>August</i></p>

<p>No letter from Bernoline in ages. Others come&mdash;from
Anne and Molly, but a blank door of silence is between
us. I think I shall write no more in this chronicle. I

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>Paris, September</i></p>

<p>I am here for three days’ <i>permission</i>. At the hotel a
packet of letters, from every one except from&mdash;her!</p>

<p>Molly is married! I cannot believe it and yet the
evidence is before me in two letters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright"><i>August, 1917.</i></p>

<p class="in0">Dear David:</p>

<p>Molly has, of course, written you of her marriage. I
know that she is tremendously upset over what you will think
of it. And, remembering some of the things you said, I am
a little afraid, too. But I know you too well, David, to fear
that you will ever write anything to hurt her. For she
needs all your love and you are the only one now that
counts with her in the loneliness of the situation she must
face. Remember, whatever you may think, Molly never did
this impulsively, but from the highest sense of her duty to
share in the anguish that this war must bring. And, David,&mdash;you
men may have one way of looking at it (the chivalry of
the American, God bless him) but every real woman will
understand Molly. And, David, could I say more than this:
despite all that may come, and it is fearful to think what may
come, if I write the truth and you can understand,&mdash;I envy
her.</p>

<p>There were some things about it that were so fine that,
whether we agree with her or not, I want you to know what
a trump your little sister is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p>She came over to spend a week with me and begged me
not to ask questions, and to let her quite alone. Naturally,
I suspected, particularly when she went off every afternoon
for long walks and shut herself up in her room the rest of
the time. So the third day I went to her and, putting my
arm around her, I asked if I couldn’t help her.</p>

<p>“No,” she said very quietly, “this is something I must decide
absolutely by myself.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I know what it is, dear,” I began, hoping to get
her to talk. “Don’t you think some one who loves you might
help you to see clearer?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“No. No one should take the responsibility of deciding
my life. Even if Davy were here, and you know what he
means to me, I should do this alone. When I’ve made up my
mind I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>At the end of the week, she told me that she was engaged
to Mr. Seaver and had made up her mind to marry him before
he left with his Division for France. I admit that I hadn’t
expected this and my breath was rather taken away.</p>

<p>“But, Molly, have you thought over all this may mean to
you?” I said at once.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You may have to begin life all over, dear, alone, perhaps
as a mother,&mdash;and you are only nineteen.”</p>

<p>“I have thought that all out.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure that it isn’t a desire simply to do a hard
thing that is influencing you?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“No. I did want to be sure of that,&mdash;to be fair to him.
Now I know. If I love him I should marry him. It is his
right and my right. If anything is going to happen to him, I
am going to share it as his wife. Anything else is cowardice.
That’s the way I feel about it.”</p>

<p>Of course, after that there was nothing more to do about it,
except to take her in my arms.</p>

<p>David, I have never seen any one quite like her. She made
up her mind and she quietly carried through her will, despite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
every one and everything. And, David, I do believe it was
her idea alone. For when Mr. Seaver came, he looked all
broken up. He is very young, of course, and perhaps Molly
does idealize him, but he is the sort of man you could trust
and it is easy to see that he adores the ground she walks on.</p>

<p>How Molly carried it through I cannot imagine, but she
did, somehow or other. She made every one do as she wanted
and that by just quietly reiterating her decision. Your
mother was terribly opposed to it, for they <i>are</i> young and Mr.
Seaver has still his way to make. His parents were terribly
distressed, and the father telegraphed Mrs. Littledale and
came down with his son in tow. There was a family conference,
with all concerned present and every one excited and
expostulating,&mdash;every one except Molly.</p>

<p>And what do you think happened? In the midst of the
uproar who should walk in but your Aunt Janie, and straight
up to Molly and put her arm around her,&mdash;which was the
only time your sister came near breaking down.</p>

<p>“If this is a question of Molly’s marrying, why am I not
consulted?” she said indignantly.</p>

<p>Molly told me that only three or four times in her life has
your Aunt Janie asserted herself, and then she frightened the
wits out of every one.</p>

<p>“Who is this gentleman? Is this the father of Mr. Seaver?”</p>

<p>The presentations were hastily made.</p>

<p>“Do I understand, sir, that you are opposing the marriage
of my niece to your son?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said Mr. Seaver, wavering a little before her eyes
(but I think, also, Molly had won him over). “So I conceive
my duty.”</p>

<p>“You ought to go down on your knees and thank God, sir,
that your son has the chance to marry any one as brave and
true and loyal as my niece.”</p>

<p>“But, good Lord, ma’am, I’ve no objection to their being
engaged,” he said hastily, “only I don’t want them to marry
now.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“My son’s too young.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s old enough for his country.”</p>

<p>“Frankly, I don’t think it is fair to your niece! Who
knows what may happen!”</p>

<p>“That’s her affair. Any other objections?” she continued,
as though she had dismissed all that had been offered before.</p>

<p>“Janie, what are they going to live on?” said your mother
at this point.</p>

<p>“Exactly. My son hasn’t a cent,” said Mr. Seaver, plucking
up courage.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>

<p>“My son hasn’t a cent,” repeated Mr. Seaver, but he must
have quailed under the awful look Molly tells me your aunt
gave him at this.</p>

<p>“Have you?”</p>

<p>The father’s jaw must have dropped at this, for he was
so astonished that he had nothing more to say.</p>

<p>“I am going to make my meaning so plain that no one
can misunderstand it,” she said, very thin, and tall, and
aroused. “If your son is willing to give his life for his
country, and my niece is ready to pledge her life to him, sir,
and face the consequences,&mdash;if these young people see their
duty and do it, we are going to stand back of them and see
them through! That’s as much our duty as going out to
fight. And now, don’t let me hear any more of this nonsense.
Molly shall marry your son, and you and I will take care of
her until he gets back from the war. If you won’t, I intend
to do it myself!”</p>

<p>Molly broke down at this. Your mother threw up her
hands and capitulated and, in the confusion, Ted Seaver’s
voice was heard, saying:</p>

<p>“Governor, it’s up to you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Seaver went over to Molly and said solemnly:</p>

<p>“Young lady, every word your aunt has said is gospel.
I’m thoroughly lambasted and convinced and mighty glad of
it. Go ahead. We <i>will</i> see you through. Molly dear,&mdash;will
you have me for a father-in-law?”</p>

<p>And married they were, with every one present and adoring
Molly. Mr. and Mrs. Seaver, who were quite won over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
wanted her to come to them, but she chose to stay at Littledale,
mainly on account of Aunt Janie, and maybe also from
pride.</p>

<p>But now that she is alone, I think the full realization has
come to her of what is ahead and though her pride will never
let her admit it, at times her dear little face is awfully serious.
You are her ideal, David. Be generous.</p>

<p>Father is in Europe. Have you seen him? The war feeling
is wonderful. All the men are going and all the women are
making ready to help. I am not satisfied with what I am
doing here in the local Red Cross and have made up my mind
to go to New York and train for a nurse’s assistant. Mother
is opposed but I, too, must decide things. She has agreed
on condition that I shall find a companion. It seems rather
unnecessary but if it will make her happy I shall do it. I
go to-morrow to stay with some cousins. Later on, I am determined
to go over but I’m not saying anything about that
now. I do appreciate your writing to me, David, as you do,
and don’t ever think you have to hide things from me.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l1">Bless you,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Anne</span>.
</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I know you’ll stand by Molly.</p>

<p>P.P.S.&mdash;It is a very great inspiration to know any one so
fine as Molly, who looks things so straight in the face and
never hesitates. It has done something for me that I shall
never forget.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright"><i>Littledale, August</i></p>

<p class="in0">My own big Brother:</p>

<p>I married Ted Seaver three days ago and to-morrow he
leaves for his camp. I do not know when I shall see him
again. I have married him knowing that he may never come
back to me. I thought it all over very hard, and when I knew
I loved him I insisted that I should have the right to share
with him whatever sacrifice he may have to face.</p>

<p>I am a little afraid of what you will think just at first,
David, dear, and oh, I don’t want you to misunderstand. I
didn’t do it impulsively or just out of a weak sentimentality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
You do know and trust me, don’t you, better than that. When
I came to realize how much I loved him, it was only the right
and simple thing to do. At first it was rather hard convincing
others&mdash;all except Aunt Janie, who was a tower of strength&mdash;but
in the end every one saw my point of view and respected
it. I don’t think they all agreed with it, but they did respect
it,&mdash;and that is all I can ask, isn’t it? For, Davy, with my
three brothers gone, I couldn’t flinch, could I, and take the
easy way out? Davy, dear, there is of course one thing I
can’t explain to you and yet it’s all, and that is the way I
love my husband. It’s just one of those things you can’t
speak about, and that you’ll have to try to understand, for
everything else is so simple when you understand that.</p>

<p>I feel ten years older than the day, you remember, when we
sat and talked in the blue sitting room and I was so broken
up about Ted’s proposing. I know now that I did care,&mdash;only
I didn’t know. I didn’t realize what I wanted in life, nor all
the finer quality in him. We have seen each other a great
deal, written to each other a great deal, and the knowledge
that I loved him came to me gradually, not all at once. I
knew what a serious thing I was doing, and do believe that I
thought it over from every side.</p>

<p>I shall be quite truthful with you, Davy. If it were not for
the war, I should have wanted to wait for a year, maybe two,&mdash;not
because I didn’t know that I could love him but because
I wanted to be more of a woman, to be of greater help
to him as his wife.</p>

<p>Will you understand? Please do, dear, even if, just at first,
you are terribly upset, as I’m afraid you’re going to be. You
will trust your little sister this far, won’t you, to know that
the man she gives her life to is worthy to be your brother.
Please do, even if you can’t approve of me, all at once. Dear
Davy, I wish you were here to-night, to catch me up in that
great bear hug of yours. I need it. I have been two days
writing this, and Ted went back this afternoon.</p>

<p>When I read these two letters and thought of Aunt
Janie (it was like her, never to refer to the captain
she didn’t marry) and dear old Molly, a lump was in my
throat. And, though it was a shock, there was only one
thing I thought of and that was what a little Spartan my
sister was. I rushed out and sent her the following cable:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>God bless you. With you from start to finish. Bully for
Aunt Janie!</p></blockquote>

<h3>VI</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<i>November, Paris</i><br />
<i>New York</i>
</p>

<p class="in0">Dear David:</p>

<p>I have been here a month, staying with my cousins, the
Barristers. You remember Nina, who was such a wild scatterbrain:
well, she has settled down into the most matter-of-fact,
quietest little worker in the world. You would never
know her. She is up at six each morning and off to her work
in the Women’s Auxiliary Corps, has given up all her society
interests and looks with scorn upon her old friends. I think
she has shamed at least a dozen of her old social set into service
work with her point-blank way of saying: “Well, what
are <i>you</i> doing in the war?”</p>

<p>At that, it isn’t quite fair, because the country is wonderful.
No matter what is asked of it, it gives immediately and impulsively.
I’m doing my part to prepare myself for service
abroad when the time comes. I know father will oppose, but
I have made up my mind and I shall go.</p>

<p>David, there is the loveliest little French woman here as
companion to Nina,&mdash;a Mademoiselle Duvernoy, and my
heart has gone right out to her. Every one adores her and I
think it is her influence that has made Nina over. There is
some story back of her deep, sad eyes, I know. You will never
get me to believe she is not a gentlewoman born and bred. I
don’t know when I have gone so impulsively to any one. Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
to be with her makes life, the right way of living, the things
that do count, seem the simplest things in the world. I
loved her from the first day we sat and talked together over
the womanhood of France, and I think she was drawn at
once to me, for she put out her hand and laid it over mine and
said:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, you have a very big and beautiful nature.
It is the suffering and the responsibilities that will bring it
out in you and make you worthy some day to be a great inspiration
to a true man. We women are not our best or happiest
when we are denied the hard things in life. And that
is where life is so different for one in your position, for those
who love you can hurt you most.”</p>

<p>She said it so sweetly and her eyes had such understanding
and such gentleness in them that I said:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Duvernoy, I don’t think I ever wanted anything
more in the world; will you really be my friend?”</p>

<p>“I have wanted to from the first,” she said. “Perhaps we
can be of help to each other.”</p>

<p>Help her? How can I help her, except by loving her, and
every one does that,&mdash;but I know what she can mean to me.</p>

<p class="sigright"><i>Later</i></p>

<p>I spoke of you to-day, and, to my surprise, she told me that
she had crossed on the steamer with you and father. Do
you remember her? I am sure you do, for no one can forget
her. I have asked her to come with me as my friend and companion,
for Nina really doesn’t need her. To my surprise and
delight, she answered:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Brinsmade, I shall do so with all my heart.”</p>

<p>I do know she is drawn to me, too, for there were tears in
her eyes as she said it. I know the Barristers won’t want to
let her go, but it is decided between us.</p></blockquote>

<p>I laid the letter down, too moved to go on. Bernoline
with Anne! Every thought that must have been in her
heart, I think, came instantly into mine at that moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
Is there any depth of sacrifice and generosity before
which her loyal nature would recoil? Never have I felt
more deeply the sublimity of sacrifice in woman. How
can I find it in my heart to rebel against her evident purpose?
For I know that what she has done has been done
for my sake in a spirit of self-effacing loyalty to my happiness
as she conceives it. Thank heaven that I know
at least that she is well and with those who love her. Yet
why has she ceased to write me?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Bernoline with Anne! No, I don’t resent it; though I
still cannot comprehend it. Why it should be so, I don’t
know, yet a feeling of great calm and certainty has come
to me since I have known it, that and a feeling of humble
reverence before something that shames me in my own
tempestuous revolt against the loneliness that has been on
me. Good God, how I love her, yet almost without hope,
as some dear vision that I have only the right to worship
from afar!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p class="sigright"><i>Paris</i></p>

<p>How could I have doubted her for a single moment!
I have been to the bank, and there were her letters awaiting
me, and on each written directions to hold until my
arrival. I tore open the first hurriedly, for the explanation
of this mystery. It was there in the first.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">My dear Friend:</p>

<p>I cannot send you my letters to the front and I have for a
long time debated whether I should even continue writing you.
For, David, among those with whom you are now in daily contact
there might be some who would recognize my handwriting,
and I have not the right to run that risk. You are too loyal
ever to seek the explanation in your imagination, as I am loyal
to the promise I gave you and which a hundred times has tortured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
my conscience. But even in conversation never, never
refer once to having met even the Mademoiselle Duvernoy
you knew on the steamer, for you might bring a sorrow too
awful to contemplate on those I must protect. Even this I
ask of you&mdash;destroy every letter I have written you. Do not
question, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>, do not seek to penetrate this mystery.
And oh, David, if by any unthinkable accident you might
guess at the truth, for my sake I ask it,&mdash;keep the knowledge
to yourself. Yes, even from me, dear friend. I must
ask this of you blindly, and without question, and I do so in
perfect faith.</p></blockquote>

<p>Blindly, and without question: yes, I shall obey her.
But the imagination,&mdash;that is another thing. A hundred
suppositions have rushed through my head, for I have
written the names of a dozen of the officers whose mess
I share, and there is one, a young captain from Brittany,
François d’Hauteville, who, strangely, has reminded me
many times of her, in coloring and in the breeding that
I know is hers,&mdash;in the very quality of his voice. Is it
possible that I have been living day after day with her
own flesh and blood and never divined it! Control my
imagination&mdash;how is it possible!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I rushed through the other letters and impatiently took
up the last one.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">Dear Friend:</p>

<p>You have probably heard from Miss Brinsmade of the way
we met at her cousin’s and of my decision to go to her. I
think, David, you will have guessed the reasons that have dictated
my decision. Believe me that it is a great happiness to
be so close to some one who is dear and necessary to you.
Since I have known her a new confidence in the future has
come to me. How could I resist her? There is something so
instantly winning in her impulsive kindness, her brave struggling
determination to be of some service, and the so evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
need of a woman’s love and faith. With everything against
her, a false education, the incitement to pleasure, the mistaken
affections of those who love her best and who would make life
only a long self-indulgence; with all against her, David, it is
wonderful how the deeper things in her&mdash;the instincts of the
real woman&mdash;have made her seek her own salvation. The
real impulse, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>, make no mistake about it, is her love
for you and the longing to stand high in your estimation. Such
an aspiration is a precious thing, David,&mdash;a trust that you
must never shatter.</p>

<p>I have talked many times with her and I love her. She
does need something that I can give her, thank God,&mdash;and
to feel that, is something that means everything to me in this
period of great indecision. It is a mission that I shall perform
very reverently, and for your sake.</p>

<p class="sigright">B.</p>

<p>I have told her only that I crossed on the steamer with you.
Send your letters always to the Convent, and I shall get them
there. Dear David, don’t begrudge me this little opportunity
for real service. I am happier to-day than I have been in
years, for I do believe that in some mysterious way Providence
has granted me the opportunity to help others to a great happiness.
This, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>, compensates for everything.</p></blockquote>

<p>When I had read this, a feeling of helplessness again
came to me. It is one thing to combat an enemy, but
how resist the quiet, self-sacrificing determination of the
one you love and who loves you! From the first I have
known that in Bernoline’s presence my will would always
yield to her inflexible view of duty. Her moral supremacy
over me was immediate, and I have never questioned
it. I accepted it as I accept it now,&mdash;as a faith.
Yet not for a moment have I relinquished hope, even
though that hope is indefinable and confused and lost in
future speculation. There must be some future happiness
in this world that can be shared together: <span class="locked">otherwise&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>Paris, December</i></p>

<p>Down on the sad duty of burying my brother, Alan.
How strangely life and death are mingled in this swift
impulse of war; Ted Seaver&mdash;Captain Seaver, now&mdash;who
informed me of Alan’s last moments, told me too of
Molly’s coming motherhood. One generation gone, and
another arriving!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We walked back together from the cemetery across
Paris, and he opened his heart to me. At first, it was
difficult. There is a certain restrictive bar that interposes
when there is this intimacy of family connections.
It is easier, often, to unburden one’s self to a stranger.
Alan’s death had upset him more than it had me, in my
acquired fatalism. It was his first contact with the closed
mystery and as always, I think, his thoughts had leaped
ahead to his own appointed hour. Yet in this supposition
I had not entirely done him justice.</p>

<p>“God, how terrible death is!” he broke out nervously,
at last.</p>

<p>“It’s not death; it’s life you’re experiencing,” I said
solemnly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Life, Ted, is just this: readiness to face the end at
any moment, our own and those who are dear to us. We
aren’t taught these things at home: nothing prepares us.
We can’t believe it till it comes, as a shock.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” said the boy, pulling at his cuff, for he
is only a boy. “I can’t get it out of my mind; I feel
jumpy all over.”</p>

<p>“It’s tough, damned tough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Littledale,” he said abruptly, “do you blame me
for marrying Molly as I did?”</p>

<p>“No-o,” I said slowly.</p>

<p>“For, you see, that’s what breaks me up. The thought
of her, of what’s coming, of what will be ahead of her,&mdash;if
anything happens to me.”</p>

<p>“Naturally, you can’t help thinking of such things,”
I admitted. “You see, Ted, there is some logic in the
military point of view that wants an officer single, isn’t
there?”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, yes. I keep thinking of it all the time,
and&mdash;wondering.”</p>

<p>“Wondering what?”</p>

<p>“What I’ll do when I get out there,&mdash;out at the front,”
he said, drawing a long breath.</p>

<p>We were walking through the crowded section, near
the Place de la Bastille. I touched his arm and drew his
attention to the crowds.</p>

<p>“See there; do you know what war has meant to them?
Do you realize, Ted, that your lot is the general lot, and
that the real sacrifice is there,&mdash;in those who remain.
Are we privileged to choose our way of service to our
country? No. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Noblesse oblige.</i> Remember that, Ted;
it answers everything.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” he said, straightening up at once. “But
it wasn’t myself I was caring about, it&mdash;it’s Molly.”</p>

<p>“Molly is no longer my sister or your wife. Molly has
gone beyond us; she represents now something bigger
and finer, the spiritual heritage of American womanhood.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t blame us?” he said.</p>

<p>“No, of course not. I shouldn’t have had the courage,
perhaps, but you of the younger generation are right.
Meet life as it offers itself: it’s a bigger thing than
avoiding it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you; that does a lot of good,” he said, drawing
a long breath.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>He is of another generation, as is Molly, too,&mdash;God
bless her. And what I said to him I believe. May it be
a generation more significant and responsive than my
own! I think it will, for it has been blessed with two
things, opportunity and the test of suffering.</p>

<p>For weeks, ever since the staggering nightmare of the
German thrust in March, we have been marching and
counter-marching, entraining and debarking, living in a
delirium. I have had no news from home in ages. Heaven
only knows where my mail has gone. I can only scribble
down a note here and there and wait for a moment that
never comes. The war has seen nothing to match this
hideous driving tempest of massed artillery. I have ceased
to think or to wonder what is in store for me. The imagination,

respond.</p>

Poor souls, now twice dispossessed from their homes!

<h3>II</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright"><i>Taunton, February</i></p>

<p class="in0">Dear David:</p>

<p>A terrible thing has happened. My head is in a whirl&mdash;oh,
my poor lovely Mademoiselle Duvernoy! How shall I
tell you? I’m afraid I’m so upset by it all that I shan’t be
able to write you anything coherently. I still can’t understand.
It all happened so suddenly to-night, only a few
hours ago.</p>

<p>We had a member of the visiting French Commission in
for dinner,&mdash;quite informally. Father telephoned at the last
minute he was bringing him and I had forgotten to mention
it (Mademoiselle Duvernoy has always been unwilling to
come down when guests were present). I was in the salon,
alone with General de Villers-Costa&mdash;that is his name and
a very distinguished and handsome officer he is&mdash;when
Mademoiselle Duvernoy came abruptly in, humming to herself.
We were so placed that she did not see the General
until she was almost on him, and then,&mdash;I thought she was
going to fall. As for him, he looked as though he had seen
a ghost!</p>

<p>David, they recognized each other! I heard them cry,</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Bernoline&mdash;Mademoiselle de Saint Omer&mdash;vous ici!”</i></p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Jacques&mdash;pour l’amour de Dieu, pas un mot!”</i></p>

<p>Then they stood together for a moment, talking very low
and rapidly, and, at the end, Mademoiselle Duvernoy went
by me without seeing me and up to her room, and General
de Villers-Costa stood at the window a long while, while I
waited, feeling as though the sky had fallen on me. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
he turned he came directly towards me, his eyes very red, in
a terrible state of excitement, and said:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Brinsmade, as you are a true and loyal
woman, I beg you to forget what you have seen and heard.”</p>

<p>I nodded. I couldn’t say a word and I think tears were in
my eyes.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle” (in his nervousness he kept pulling at his
handkerchief), “did you hear the name I pronounced?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur.”</p>

<p>This seemed to overwhelm him completely, for it was a
long moment before he could continue.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle&mdash;will you believe me that it is all a mistake&mdash;an
astounding mistake&mdash;and will you, in charity&mdash;I
ask of you&mdash;forget it?”</p>

<p>“I love Mademoiselle Duvernoy,” I said. “I never could
do anything to hurt her.”</p>

<p>At that moment the others came in. I hurried upstairs,
but she was not in her room. I ran out in the garden, and,
at the end of the walk, I found her sitting, and oh, David,&mdash;the
look on her face! I flung my arms about her and wept as
though my heart would break and, for the first time, tears
came to her too, and we clung to each other. She has told
me nothing, though I know she loves me dearly, but just goes
about staring in a numbed sort of way. David, what does
it mean? What awful tragedy is in her life,&mdash;in the life of
that dear little saint! David, I looked up her name in the
Almanach de Gotha, and there is only one family of that
name, the Duc Henri Plessis de Saint Omer: four sons, and&mdash;Bernoline
Marie Renée Plessis de Saint Omer! Is it possible
<span class="locked">that&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>David, just as I was writing, she came into my room, and
oh, David, she has told me all. There have been times when
I suspected but I am overwhelmed. I must try to set it
down as it happened, for she wishes me to write to you.</p>

<p>I was so buried in my letter that I had not heard her entrance
until I felt her hand on my shoulder and looked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
to see her at my side. My face, I know, went red, and involuntarily
I tried to cover up my letter.</p>

<p>“You have written it to David!” she said, looking into my
eyes.</p>

<p>And then I guessed! All that I have merely wondered at&mdash;put
out of my mind as impossible, as fantastic, flashed back.
I knew, and she knew that I knew, for she said swiftly:</p>

<p>“He is the man that I have loved as I have never loved any
one in my life.”</p>

<p>I write it to you, as she said it, as you have the right to
know.</p>

<p>“And whom I shall never see again,” she added. “It is
better that you should write it, dear child.”</p>

<p>I flung myself in her arms and begged her forgiveness, not
knowing what I did. I won’t tell you all she said, David, only
that I know now how you love her, for who could help loving
her.</p>

<p class="sigright"><i>Later</i></p>

<p>The terrible, terrible thing is that she is going away. I have
pleaded with her to stay as my friend: think what it must
have been to her pride all these months&mdash;but nothing can
move her. There is something mysterious under it all, something
dreadful&mdash;I don’t dare ask&mdash;that I feel no one has
a right to know.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>That night, she came down to dinner. I was so broken up
when I saw her enter that I couldn’t look at her, and the
General stopped short and then began to talk rapidly. She
came to me presently, and, in the same quiet tone, said:</p>

<p>“Anne, dear, I count on your help to-night. Be calm, dear,
and after dinner,&mdash;I must speak to General de Villers-Costa.”</p>

<p>Her control was absolute, yet I wonder that every one did not
see the change, for it was no longer Mademoiselle Duvernoy
who was in the room, but Bernoline, daughter of the Duke de
St. Omer. Beyond that there was not a trace of emotion in face
or manner. She must have a will of iron!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span></p>

<p>Dinner over, I managed to signal the General, and the three
of us went into the garden together until we were well hidden
from the house.</p>

<p>“And now, Anne, dear, thank you, and may I ask you to
wait for us here just a moment. Monsieur de Villers-Costa,
will you walk with me a little ahead?”</p>

<p>It must have been at least ten minutes before they returned,
and the General was so evidently upset that he could not say
a word as we came back. At the terrace Mademoiselle de
Saint Omer turned and said, with the gracious smile which is
hers alone,</p>

<p>“In this sad day I am fortunate in having two such loyal
friends in whom I have perfect trust.”</p>

<p>Wasn’t that fine of her: not a question of our promising,&mdash;just
trust! Then she went into the house, but as I started to
follow her, the General stopped me.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle&mdash;I beg of you&mdash;just a moment. I haven’t
that strength&mdash;a moment to get hold of myself.”</p>

<p>“I, too,” I said hastily, and we went and leaned over the
balustrade, without a word.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said, at last, drawing himself up. “I can
go in, now.” And he added, with a little touch of pride I
loved, “Such are our women, Mademoiselle,&mdash;do you wonder
that we fight on?”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>She left to-day. Every one is terribly broken up,&mdash;even
the servants, who, I think, instinctively felt her quality. She
is returning to the convent in New York, but I think her
intention is to sail for France. I feel so helpless, and so
alone.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I could not write you last night and had to put my pen
down. I don’t know when I have been so completely broken
up. It seems all so hideously unjust. She told me that she
had written you, for the last time, but I cannot believe that.
Surely, there must be some way out; life can’t be so cruel as
that. David, my dear friend, will you believe me that I have
thought of you all these days and that my heart goes out to
you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span></p>

<p>The shock must have been terrible to her, for everything
about her seemed absolutely petrified and her eyes looked at
you with such a dry, such a burning heat. She never seemed
to know she was talking to us or to be aware of what was
around her. Her whole mind is concentrated on some fixed
resolve. That is the terrible part,&mdash;with all my love, I cannot
help her!</p>

<p>I shall not forget her last words when I caught her hands
and implored her a last time not to go.</p>

<p>“I have failed: and this is my punishment.”</p>

<p>Whatever can she mean, David, and what is it she is
planning to do?</p>

<p class="sigright"><i>New York</i></p>

<p>Just a last line. I am sailing next week for France. I
have enlisted for the war in the Red Cross as a hospital
assistant. Father has arranged all for me, like the dear that
he is,&mdash;without a single objection. And what do you think:
I have seen Mademoiselle Duvernoy, and we are going over
on the same boat! I know that this will be some comfort
to you, for, David, I, too, love her, and I know she loves me,
and is glad that I am to be with her. My address in Paris
is below: it is quicker, they tell me, than the Red Cross. If
you are in Paris before I go to my post, do come to me, David.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="l1"><i>St. Rosa’s Convent,</i></span><br />
<i>New York</i>
</p>

<p class="in0">David:</p>

<p>I am here with the good sisters. In a week I sail for
France. This must be my last letter to you, and I shrink
from the pain that it must bring you. Anne has written you
what happened at Taunton. She knows only who I am,
and my cousin, General de Villers-Costa, whatever he may
suspect, knows no more. He is of my blood, and he is an
absolutely loyal gentleman. His lips are sealed. To you alone
I must tell everything. Better for us both if I had done
so in the beginning. I couldn’t. You will understand why.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>
<p>David, I have told only two deliberate lies in my life, and
each has been followed by a dreadful calamity: the first to
save the life of a soldier of France; and the second to you,
when you asked me if I were married. I did it because I
thought I was doing it for your sake, because I was tried
beyond my strength, because I no longer knew what to do,
and because, David, I couldn’t bear to leave in your heart
a memory that would haunt you. I tell you now because it is
inevitable.</p>

<p>David, I have failed, and God has seen fit to punish me.
For months I have been tortured by remorse, for months I
have refused to bear the full burden of my cross, and no
one will ever know&mdash;not even you&mdash;the agony of my indecision.
Now, my way is clear. I know what I must do, and
I shall do it.</p>

<p>David, it is so hard to tell you, for as you know now, I
am of an old and proud race, that guards its honor with its life;
and, David, I am a woman who loves you. Forgive me, if
you can, in my weakness. My family thinks me dead. For
their sake, for the honor of my family, of my brother, whom
you know now is at your side, I am and must remain dead.
When I tried to escape from my destiny it was for their sake
and their sake alone. Only one other person in this world
besides you knows the truth, and that is Marianne, my old
nurse, whom you saw at Bordeaux, and who has in her keeping
my baby.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you in detail; that would be too horrible, and
all the courage that I have built up would not be proof
against that hideous memory.</p>

<p>You know that my mother and I were caught in the first
German rush through Luxemburg. Our château was but a
few kilometers from the border. It was taken and retaken,
again and again. We stayed, as a duty to our peasants, to our
old men and to our poor women and children. We believed
in our pride that the authority of our name and presence
could save them from torture and worse than torture. How
little we knew the beasts with whom we were dealing! We
thought we were safe, for the German commander was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
acquaintance of my brothers,&mdash;had visited us in our home in
the years before the war! For we knew many Germans and
we trusted in the honor of a gentleman of noble descent!</p>

<p>David, it is so hard to write it down. I can only do it by
moments. Twice we were accused of signaling to the French,&mdash;twice
imprisoned and threatened with execution,&mdash;we
who gave our days and nights to but one thought,&mdash;the comforting
of the dying, friend and enemy. We saw our home
battered to pieces, everything we loved destroyed, everything
we owned in the world wiped out, and yet, despite every
agony, we stayed on, trusting in our sacred mission, to protect
and aid those we loved.</p>

<p>And then came the lie. He was a little <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i>, hardly more
than a boy, who had been left behind, too wounded to carry
away. We hid him in our own apartment, my mother and I,
and to do it we lied. God forgive me, I would do it again!
For discovery meant death: he was an Alsatian and for them
the Boches know no pity. For three long weeks we were able
to conceal his presence,&mdash;until he was able to make a try at
escape. They caught him and all was discovered. And <span class="locked">then&mdash;</span></p>

<p>They tore my mother from me and sent her off somewhere
into the interior, to work in the fields. She was spared the
worst,&mdash;the knowledge of what happened to me. She died.
And to me came worse than death,&mdash;but oh, the ferocity of
it, the brutality of it, the stamping of a weak woman with
the rage of the victor; and he who did it was the one, above
all, who by every tradition of chivalry, by every instinct of
race, religion and <span class="locked">honor&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>David, my religion, my faith was all that was left me.
What was I to do? To take one’s life is to us a mortal sin;
even that escape was denied me. And the horror when I
knew that my shame was eternally fastened upon me! For
the first months I sought death as only I had the right to seek
it, praying for the mercy of a quick end, exposing myself in
every bombardment, seeking every post of danger. Men
were killed at my side&mdash;a child that ran to me was blown
to pieces&mdash;and I lived.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>
<p>Then, for the sixth time, our little village was retaken, and
I escaped that night into France. A faithful soul gave out the
report that I had been killed, and so, thank God, for the
honor of my name, I am dead to-day.</p>

<p>The rest? I found my old nurse, Marianne, who concealed
my identity and placed the baby (I have never been able to
call it mine) with her family. I rebelled against it&mdash;God
forgive me for that sin, as He in His high righteousness has
seen fit to punish me. David, what those months were only
a woman can know.</p>

<p>I had not meant to write you like this: but I cannot write
it calmly. I have never rebelled against God,&mdash;only sometimes,
I have not been able to understand. I have tried to
think of His stern and equal justice. I have tried to think of
all the other women,&mdash;yes, of those who have suffered more
hideously than I. There was a girl&mdash;a child&mdash;but no, I
cannot even write it. I try to say to myself that it is right
that we too, the proud women of France, should suffer with
the humblest.</p>

<p>David, where I was wrong was in trying to escape from
what was in the will of God. It was my baby, and I forsook
it. Night and day, that remorse, that conflict has been in
my heart. And now, that through His justice, God has
opened my eyes, I know my duty. I am going back to him,&mdash;my
baby. I shall disappear from the world. No one shall
ever know from now on what has become of me. But, since
this is my cross, and since life in this world is not for me, I
shall take up that cross, and, little by little, I shall learn no
longer to rebel. The Holy Virgin, Mother of Sorrows, will
watch over me and give me that courage. The child of hate
is still an immortal soul and I, its mother, must save it for
eternity.</p>

<p>David, I had thought that to write all this to you would
break me. It has not. I feel as though something had
purified my spirit, and I feel all at once a clarity of vision,
a courage that is calm and will not falter. The truth, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon
ami</i>, cannot weaken us. It is only when we refuse to face it
that we are weak. I feel this so strongly. Share this knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
with me, and do not suffer for me. I am no longer of
this world.</p>

<p>David, it is only of you I think now. Now that the moment
has come to say farewell, I can tell you all the love that is
in my heart for you, has always been, will always be. David,
how little you guessed what was in my heart, for I think I
loved you from the first moment our eyes met,&mdash;when I saw
in yours that look of sympathy&mdash;there on the dock. When
you came to me that night on the deck, out of the night, and
stood by my side, I knew that if I did not fight against it
with all my will, I should love you and bring sorrow into your
life. And how I fought against you! But in the moment
when I felt the strongest I would see a look in your eyes, a
wounded, uncomprehending look, and all my strength would
go. At times it was all I could do to keep back the tears from
my eyes! If only I had not seen all the need of a woman’s
love in your life!</p>

<p>And then, one night, after long sleepless hours, I had such
a strange dream. I dreamed that I was on a rock in the
midst of a great sea that rose and swirled about me, and, all
at once I looked down and saw your face in the waters, and
you were struggling towards me. I ran down to the edge
and stretched out my hands and caught you and drew you
up to safety, all wet and limp in my arms. And, ever since,
this has haunted me, and at times I have seen in it a sign of
your struggling to find your true self and that I, in some
mysterious way, was meant to give you strength. I was so
torn by differing impulses. I passed such long hours in my
little berth, praying to the dear Virgin to help me to struggle,
to be strong for your sake. But the moment I came into your
presence, the moment I met your eyes, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>, I was just a
woman, a weak, helpless woman, whose whole being went to
you in the longing to love and be loved.</p>

<p>David, may God forgive me if I have done wrong by you;
forgive me, too,&mdash;for I have loved you with every thought and
every impulse of my life, with an intensity beyond my
strength. I love you as only those can love, who have known
the depths of sorrow and suffering; as those who need love in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
their lives. If it had only been possible, what happiness I
could have given thee, David, to you, who were so gentle and
so strong! I know I haven’t the right to say this, but I must!
Just for these minutes, I am what I was born to be. Don’t
utterly forget me, David,&mdash;or rather, yes, utterly forget me,
for your sake. I do not know any longer what I am saying,
and to end is the end of all. Forget me. It is right and your
duty. You must, for your sake, for my sake: but, afterwards,
long years afterwards,&mdash;when you can do so calmly, remember
that somewhere in this world, just as the dusk comes in
over the world,&mdash;I shall be kneeling and praying for your
happiness.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>I have been in a stupor for hours, my mind paralyzed,
my brain unable to comprehend. Instead of rereading
the letter eagerly, I put it mechanically back in its
envelope and wrapped it up in the little rubber-lined case
I carry along with me. I do not know that I shall ever
be able to bring myself to read it again. It is too hideous&mdash;too
incomprehensible. Good God! Such things do
not happen! But why? Why? No, I cannot realize it!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>For fifty-eight hours I have not lain down or closed my
eyes. Ordinarily, after a second night of watchfulness,
my physical nature revolts and I tumble over unconsciously.
But now, at this moment, I am as keenly awake
as though sleep were unknown to my brain. Inside my
head, there is a feeling of a great, shining, hollow vacancy,
and my little thoughts seem to rattle around in
its luminous space, quite lost. I have done the strangest
things, with a perfectly calm exterior. This morning I
came upon a group of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilus</i>, kneeling before a priest,
Père Glorieux, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i> likewise, a black robe hastily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
drawn over his soiled uniform,&mdash;giving the Communion
with a solemn majesty that I shall ever remember. I went
and knelt among them, gazing up at the rough bearded
face with eyes that shone down into my soul, quite
unconscious of anything further than the instinct within
me. When he came to me, he hesitated.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vous êtes catholique, mon fils?</i>”</p>

<p>I drew up, hastily.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Non, non, je ne suis pas catholique. Pardon.</i>”</p>

<p>He bowed, hardly noticing the strangeness of my actions
in the tumult about us, and I moved away, without
realization either,&mdash;I was thinking of Bernoline.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>That afternoon I slept for the first time. One moment
I had been moving around, giving orders for the storing
of our kit, and the next&mdash;I must have dropped suddenly
like a drunken man, for when I came to, it was late afternoon,
and my orderly told me I had slept fourteen hours
without moving. I remember nothing of the last four
days, except,&mdash;except that letter. Yet I have been, to
all intents and purposes, a rational man, moving and
speaking instinctively, meeting and answering my fellow
officers,&mdash;and all is a blur. I remember no more than
a swimming sensation of being buffeted in contending
floods of humanity; of hearing motor lorries roaring
endlessly in my ears; of being thundered over, shrieked
over; of being borne along on the flotsam and jetsam of
human tides, with dimly remembered half-lights; of a
child’s running to a dressing station, holding a broken
jaw together; of a dog to whom I fed a crust; of an old
woman, with red stockings, riding on an army kitchen,
and I think I must have broken into a laugh!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Still we are in the back wash of refugees, old men,
women, cattle, wounded <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilus</i> straggling to the rear, torn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
regiments returning. They pass us like apparitions, eyes
set and sullen. Only occasionally a cry from the ranks,
a cry of old age or defiant youth, but the rest, the muddied
human flood, rolls by, grim and inert. Fatalism!
In our ranks a great deal of grumbling, but we know what
that grumbling is worth. The aspect of the fields is
hideous. The only thing which rouses our resentment is
the passing to and fro of Boche aeroplanes and the sudden
spurts of flame beneath them as they pass. We hate
them, with a blind, unreasoning hatred, as the tiger must
hate the weapon that slays it from a safe distance. For
the rest, indifference.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The attack seems stemmed. We are in the second
line, ready to relieve the &mdash;&mdash;th Division when our turn
comes. Our aeroplanes have swarmed in, and everywhere
there are strange falcon-like encounters, under the
clouds and above them. To-day, as I was seeking General
La Pierre’s headquarters, Maurice de Saint Omer
hailed me around a jutting wall.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Eh, l’Americain!</i> David, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon bon vieux</i>! Still
alive?”</p>

<p>I shrank from him; why, I don’t know. But the
touch of his hand hurt me.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mais, qu’est-ce que tu as, mon vieux. Tu es blessé?</i>”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;sleep!”</p>

<p>“Turn in here. We have a cellar as luxurious as the
Ritz. Lunched?”</p>

<p>“Sufficiently.” I could not look at him. It seemed
a dream, to be letting him chatter on so nonchalantly,
with the letter that lay in my pocket. “Only just located
you. How’s every one?”</p>

<p>“Not so bad,” he said, looking around. “Pretty warm
at times. D’Arvilliers, poor fellow, blown to pieces&mdash;a
few flesh wounds. We counter-attacked the day before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
yesterday. Hot work. Took a number of prisoners. The
Boches are fagged out. Nothing to eat for days.”</p>

<p>“Have we stopped them?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely. Enormous losses. This time they’re done
for!”</p>

<p>Others grumble and look serious; with him, not an
instant’s wavering. Victory is his faith. There I recognize
the race of Bernoline.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Bernoline! For all these days I have rejected her from
my mind, by some involuntary instinct of self-preservation.
I think at times during that blank moment it must
have been touch and go with me. Where was my mind
all the while? Who knows? That I am still able to reason
sanely may be due to this hideous obsession of panic
and retreat which has mercifully crowded in on my struggling
consciousness. Still I cannot realize it!</p>

<p>I have just taken out the two letters and examined the
postmarks. They were mailed five weeks ago. She has
been in France, then, for weeks!</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>IV</h3>

<p>And, in this moment of all moments, a letter from
Letty. Others I had taken and torn to shreds. When
this came, I laughed out loud and opened it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">David mio</i>:</p>

<p>You love me: you have always loved me, or you could not
have hated me so. It is in your blood. I loved you and I
love you, or I could never have done the thing I did. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Que
voulez vous?</i> We are made as we are made. Why struggle,
and what is your victory worth?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>
<p>Come back to me. You will find me changed in all but
one thing. Yes, I am a little pagan: I am good and bad: I
am capricious, changing, cruel, but I love you! <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Tu te souviens?</i>
What is all the rest worth? <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Viens, pour un jour or
pour toujours! A ton plaisir, mon roi!</i></p>

<p>You will not believe me? I sign my name in full.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Letty de Tinquerville Littledale.</span>
</p>

<p>A woman who dares to do that <i>must</i> love you!</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Letty.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>We struggle on and we say to ourselves that we can
struggle just so far. Yet we go on struggling until there
comes a moment of utter defeat, a moment of terrible
weakness, of crushing moral fatigue, when the will cries
out that too much has been asked of it and we are ready
to throw over everything. Up to such a breaking point
we can contend: that reached, everything crumbles and
the rest is panic. I know. I have been there.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Thank God I was not in the Paris of Letty at that
moment, when I was saying to myself, “Why be tormented
by a conscience&mdash;why deny one’s self for an
ideal&mdash;when all it means is this dead loneliness, this
blank ache of denial, this laying bare of a hundred nerves
to daily pain!”</p>

<p>A sudden hatred swept over me against myself, a scorn
and a bitter rebellion. Why couldn’t I be like other
men, who close up their hearts, cease dreaming, and
avoid the price of great emotions? To take life in little
measures, to play in the shallows and avoid the tempestuous
depths: other men, most men, live in this tranquil,
tolerant attitude; why not I? They may never know
the exaltation of a moment but they will not bear the
dead despair of years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, just for that moment&mdash;the bitterest in my life&mdash;everything
in me rebelled against myself. I cursed myself:
I ridiculed my compunctions and my sickly conscience,
my oversensitive imagination, and my groping
after futility. I hated everything I was and everything
I had done that had brought me to this living bankruptcy.
I broke into a laugh&mdash;a laugh of contempt and derision
at myself&mdash;flung into my things and went riotously into
the night, seeking some befuddling oblivion,&mdash;some
sudden end of this martyrdom of discipline&mdash;and, after
a quarter of an hour’s blind wandering, I turned abruptly
into an open chapel and down on my knees, there to remain
inertly until the frenzy had spent itself! But&mdash;if
it had been Paris&mdash;and Letty’s shadowy eyes at my

<p>This was two days ago. The storm has passed. Somehow,
the struggle has been met anew. I take no credit.
That moment of weakness was too real. A man who
looks back honestly over his own life is terrified at the
things that did not happen,&mdash;and not by the strength
of his own will, but by the saving quality of circumstance
or accident. Few women can understand this: every
man will.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Action has cleared my brain&mdash;the necessity of going
on&mdash;of doing some little, appointed thing. The tension
is relaxing; the swaying, stumbling conflict has stabilized
itself. Arras is saved and we have even counter-attacked
the attackers and regained some ground! Many prisoners
are coming in.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I have been out with a covering party cleaning up the
dugouts and among other discoveries we have made prisoner
a fierce-looking old fellow&mdash;quite a prize&mdash;a General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
von Holwitz. His left arm was pretty badly shot
up. So I was delegated to take him to a dressing station
and have it attended to. Brought him back to our post,
as he looks pretty much played out, and coffee and a
touch of brandy will pull him up amazingly. Even if he
is a Boche, he is a gentleman and an officer.</p>

<p>De Saint Omer came in while I was feeding my prisoner,
and recognized him as an old acquaintance of pre-war
days. Curiously enough, Von Holwitz was visibly
upset by the meeting and drew back into his Prussian
shell. But that is the way with these war lords,&mdash;defeat
is something they cannot bear, and I fancy that the humiliation
of being made a prisoner is galling to him.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Our dugout is about six miles back of the front lines
but as we are in a strategic village the crossroads are
heavily bombarded. The cellars are full of refugees. De
Saint Omer’s attitude towards his prisoner is strictly
courteous but the conversation is along conventional lines,
naturally. To-night Von Holwitz sleeps with us; to-morrow
he goes to the rear, while we, in all probability,
are destined for a forward sector.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>In Germany, February, 1919</i></p>

<p>Ten months have passed since I broke off,&mdash;ten
months in which I have shrunk again and again from
opening this chronicle to write down the final chapters.
For months, only the constant affection of De Saint Omer,
who has watched over me like a brother, and the loyalty
of Anne have kept me sane and struggling to accept life
as it has had to be readjusted and lived out. I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
through battle after battle, buried twice under a torrent
of shells, sought the thickest of the danger, and come
through unscathed. The war is ended, the armistice has
come, and ahead is the more difficult thing&mdash;life.</p>

<p>A month ago I tried to write and gave it up. This
last week a new calm has come into my spirit,&mdash;a
strange, sudden convalescence, like the lifting of a long
fever. I shall suffer to write down the end, and yet I
shall suffer more until it is done. It is only the record
of a last few hours, six or seven in all, and yet it is the
record of the ending of a lifetime and the beginning of
another. To write it will not be difficult. Every word,
every look is implanted in my memory, has haunted me
in the delirium of the night and the walking unreality
of the day, from the moment I came into the courtyard
at R&mdash;&mdash; until the final parting, when I saw her with
the baby in her arms.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>She might have come, passed at my side and gone, without
my ever knowing it if it had not been for her old
nurse, Marianne. R&mdash;&mdash; was under a prolonged bombardment
that morning. The Boches must have had wind
of the passage of an artillery support, for they opened
up on the crossroads in the public square at dark and
kept at it venomously all night. Our casualties were
heavy and, just before dawn, a squadron of Fokkers
bombed us, adding to the inferno. We stuck close to our
cellars all morning,&mdash;De Saint Omer, our Boche Von Holwitz,
and myself, but towards noon, as the fire seemed to
lessen somewhat, or rather to leave the streets of the
village and concentrate on the Square, De Saint Omer
decided to take his prisoner back to headquarters and
have him sent to the rear. He went out with Von Holwitz
who, to give the devil his due, showed good nerve,
and I promised to follow presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span></p>

<p>I finished shaving and tidying up and started after
them, but hardly had I poked my head out before the
Boches began to search out the village with shrapnel, and
I was driven to shelter. At the end of an hour I succeeded
in making my way through the ruins of cellars to
an area of comparative quiet. The streets were badly
cut up and blocked. I crossed behind a pile of masonry,
entered the wreck of the church, and gaining the shelter
of a wall, passed into the garden of what had once been
a convent. There I stopped amazed.</p>

<p>A child&mdash;hardly more than a baby&mdash;was seated in
the gravel path, gravely picking up the pebbles and build them
in heaps, and by his side an old peasant woman, on
her knees, was sobbing and telling her beads.</p>

<p>The village had, I knew, its smatter of refugees, hidden
away in cellars, awaiting an opportunity to escape, and
the spot was somewhat out of the line of fire. But the
sight of a child, sitting unconcernedly there, under the
split skies where shells were screaming to and fro, while
half a mile away the houses were crumbling and great
holes being torn in the streets, filled me with horror.</p>

<p>I stepped forward, and said, peremptorily:</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Que diable faites vous ici, ma bonne vielle?”</i></p>

<p>She looked up at me, startled at my voice. I stared
at her, sprang back, started forward and, placing my
hand on her shoulder, peered at her. Over the passage
of months, of a hundred shifting scenes, a memory came
slowly back to me, a face seen in the wet dawn of a November
morning, on the docks at Bordeaux.</p>

<p>“Marianne!”</p>

<p>Her jaw dropped and she started up, staring at me,&mdash;but
no recognition came to her.</p>

<p>Marianne! Then the child <span class="locked">was&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The next moment, I heard De Saint Omer’s voice
around the wall. A sudden flash of what had happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
came to me. I stumbled to the opening, turned the
corner, and came upon them: De Saint Omer, Von
Holwitz, planted in a corner, and before me, in the
blue and white uniform of the Red Cross&mdash;Bernoline!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The next moment, oblivious of all the rest, I had her
in my arms. She lay there, inert, weakly incapable of
words, a poor, fluttering bird, listening to my voice that
cried out to her. Gradually, her arms rose, passed around
my neck, and tightened there.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ah, mon Dieu</i>, even you!”</p>

<p>I realized nothing; neither the significance of her
cry of despair, nor the grim erectness of the brother, nor
the shadowy third, waiting with crossed arms against the
wall. I only knew life had come again to me. I had
her. I would never let her go. She had come to me
again, again into my life! No matter what had been the
past, no matter what her reasons, her pleadings or her
will,&mdash;this time nothing could separate us again. I had
come out of the inferno and the delirium back to life
and hope.</p>

<p>“Bernoline, I have almost gone mad!”</p>

<p>She took my head in her hands and looked in my eyes.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ah mon bien aimé</i>&mdash;if I could have spared you this!
David, give me your strength for these last minutes!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>I looked from her to the two men and back again. Still
I did not seize the situation. Then, all at once, the tense
rigidity of their attitudes struck me. I had the feeling
of arriving on the skirts of tragedy,&mdash;of something having
happened before, of my being out of it&mdash;an intruder,
a mere spectator&mdash;while something ominous and terrifying
was moving to its culmination. I felt that and instinctively
I caught her in my arms again, to hold her against
the unseen thing that threatened us. I tried to collect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
my wits to piece together this mystery. If De Saint Omer
were here&mdash;then he, too, knew. Bernoline had told him;
with the child present no concealment was possible.</p>

<p>Then, I think for the first time, out of the blur, I became
aware of the incongruity of Von Holwitz being
there. I looked at him and saw the stone pallor on his
face. Yet I did not understand.</p>

<p>“What is it? What are you all waiting for? Bernoline,
why is that man here?”</p>

<p>Then I saw it in her face! Good God!</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>VI</h3>

<p>When I next remember anything, Bernoline’s arms
were around me, and I was staring at Von Holwitz, who
was gasping for breath against the wall, a streak of blood
curved on his cheek. De Saint Omer&mdash;he must have
had arms of steel&mdash;had me by the collar, and I heard
Bernoline crying,</p>

<p>“David, David, for my sake&mdash;don’t!”</p>

<p>I turned and looked at her,&mdash;a look that must have
frightened her, for I heard her say:</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ah, mon bien aimé</i>, will you desert me now?”</p>

<p>My brain cleared instantly. I put my hand over my
eyes and pressed against the dull numbness that filled
my head. When I looked up, De Saint Omer had loosened
his hold and stood watching me.</p>

<p>“David, understand well one thing,” he said sharply,
to bring me to my senses. “As head of my family, I
<i>command</i> here.”</p>

<p>Even then nothing could have held me,&mdash;nothing but
the touch of her hand.</p>

<p>“God! You can stand here and <i>reason</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span></p>

<p>“Come to your senses! At once!” he ripped out, with
the suddenness of a drill master. “Do you hear me,
<i>Lieutenant</i> Littledale! At once!”</p>

<p>It was incongruous, grotesque, and involuntary, but
I came to attention and my hand went up in salute. Our
eyes met, and what I saw there made me forget everything
else.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Pardon, mon commandant.</i> I am at your orders.”</p>

<p>Then I looked at Von Holwitz; if there was death
brooding in the face of De Saint Omer, the face of the
other was the face of the dead.</p>

<p>“David, you will do everything exactly as I decide,”
De Saint Omer said more quietly, though his eyes continued
to blaze imperiously, dominating my own. “Monsieur,
I am quite capable of protecting the honor of my
sister and the name of my family.”</p>

<p>“Do as he says, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon ami</i>” said Bernoline, staring past
me. “He has the right.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon commandant</i>,” I repeated stiffly. “I shall obey.”</p>

<p>From that moment everything seemed to occur outside
of me. I was there, but only to look on helplessly and incredulously,&mdash;an
American watching the unfolding of
some grim scene in the Middle Ages, a spectator before
an older race, disciplined, proud, exact to their point of
honor, as their old grim generations had held to that
honor.</p>

<p>I, who could understand but the instinct of murder&mdash;blinding,
groping, two-handed murder&mdash;was dominated,
morally and physically, by the cold, punctilious, relentless
decision in the burning eyes of De Saint Omer that
sent a chill into my heart as though I were back in the
days of the Sforzas and Malatestas. What was he going
to do? What were they waiting for?</p>

<p>The next moment I knew. The gravel cried out; a
shadow fell between us, and a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i> stood at attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon commandant</i>, you sent for me?”</p>

<p>It was Père Glorieux, soldier of God and France, gun
in hand, knapsack on his back.</p>

<p>“You have your surplice?”</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Oui, mon commandant.”</i></p>

<p>“Good. Just a moment.” He turned to me, designating
Von Holwitz with his thumb. “You have your
revolver?”</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Oui, mon commandant.”</i></p>

<p>I drew it but I did not trust myself to meet the eyes of
Von Holwitz, who was sitting and staunching his wound
with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Save yourself the trouble,” I heard him say. “I
expect nothing!”</p>

<p>De Saint Omer, moving to one side, began to talk to
Père Glorieux. Once or twice I saw the soldier start
and glance in our direction, but immediately he controlled
himself. Finally they returned.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, it is customary to confess,” Père Glorieux
began, to my growing amazement.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon père</i>&mdash;I did&mdash;this morning.”</p>

<p>“I shall take communion, too,” said De Saint Omer.
“If you will hear me, first&mdash;”</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i>, for he still was the soldier, passed on and
confronted Von Holwitz.</p>

<p>“You are Catholic?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Do you do this willingly?”</p>

<p>“More than willingly.”</p>

<p>“For the good of your soul, my son, you will confess!”</p>

<p>“That is my desire.”</p>

<p>He straightened up, solemn and abrupt, but the assumption
of dignity was spoiled by the wound on his cheek
which continued to flow and against which he kept continually
pressing his handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>

<p>“Commandant de Saint Omer, I do not expect any
mercy. I would not ask for it. That is understood. I
ask you to trust to my honor. I shall not evade any decision
you make.”</p>

<p>“Your honor?”</p>

<p>“There <i>is</i> an honor at such times&mdash;among men of
our kind,” he said stubbornly.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the phrase of Alan’s flashed into my
mind; every man, his code. Even Von Holwitz, brute
and bully, wished to die like an officer. I think De Saint
Omer saw that, for he nodded, and I pocketed my revolver.</p>

<p>“Follow me,” he said peremptorily.</p>

<p>The three men moved across the garden, to a further
niche in the wall. Père Glorieux, opening his knapsack,
drew a surplice over his uniform and rose with a sudden
majesty. De Saint Omer had fallen to his knees, while
Von Holwitz waited, sitting some distance apart.</p>

<p>I had my arm around Bernoline, still supporting her
broken strength, and at last I turned to her, screwing up
courage to ask the question I feared.</p>

<p>“Bernoline!”</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Oui, mon ami?”</i></p>

<p>“What is it they’re going to do? What is going to
happen?”</p>

<p>She tried to tell me, but couldn’t. Again I asked the
question.</p>

<p>“You do not know?”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, what is it?”</p>

<p>“David&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;am to marry him!”</p>

<p>“Marry <i>him</i>!”</p>

<p>“It is for the honor of the family,” she said, as a tired
child repeats a formula. “Maurice has said it must be
so. I have no choice.”</p>

<p>“And afterward?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>

<p>She shivered and sagged against my shoulder. Again
the world went black about me. To stand at her side
and to witness that! Yet I knew I was powerless to
oppose, and even in my misery I gave justice to his
reason. The first part was clear, but&mdash;afterwards? The
time seemed endless, as we waited there, clinging to each
other, too numb with the sense of pain to utter word or
protest.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Littledale!”</p>

<p>I came sharply back to my senses.</p>

<p>“Follow us&mdash;take care of my sister&mdash;into the
chapel&mdash;”</p>

<p>Père Glorieux first, then the two men, side by side,
and back of them Bernoline and I; so we went, around the
wall, where, I remember, Marianne’s wrinkled face shone
wet with tears. There a ghastly thing happened.</p>

<p>The child, startled by our apparition, started to run,
stumbled, and lurched against the leg of Von Holwitz.
Never shall I forget the look on his face as he looked
down!</p>

<p>Bernoline sprang forward, an instinctive movement of
motherhood&mdash;who knows, perhaps the first&mdash;and
snatched him up. The child, frightened, began to cry.
I took him hurriedly and put him in the arms of the
nurse. Bernoline stood, waiting my return, and the tears
were standing in her eyes as she looked back.</p>

<p>“God help me to feel as a mother,” she said, staring
beyond me. “David, your hand.”</p>

<p>Together, we picked our way across the strewn débris
to the chapel.</p>

<p>“Charlotte Corday! Charlotte Corday!” kept running
through my mind. Why? I don’t know. An irrelevant
suggestion, unless it were the feeling of a martyr
in the tumbrils of the Revolution, going to her execution.
Yes, I think that was the thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>

<p>I remember little of the mockery of a service. I stood
in the shadows, unable to think or pray, hearing from
time to time the shriek of a traveling shell, the mumbled,
hurried cadences from the altar, and across the shattered
walls, from time to time, in the quiet between explosions,
the cry of the child; that child who, too, was a human
being with an immortal soul, and must work out its destiny
of wrath. Once, a stray shell burst several hundred
yards away and a flying crumb of masonry fell in the
nave and ricocheted a moment. No one moved. De
Saint Omer stood like an avenging angel, arms folded,
waiting.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was over. She came to me directly, gave a little sigh,
and lay shuddering in my arms.</p>

<p>“And now?”</p>

<p>It was the voice of Von Holwitz, facing his judge.</p>

<p>“Follow me.”</p>

<p>“Murder?”</p>

<p>At this Bernoline started up and running to her
brother, caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Maurice, qu’est-ce que tu vas faire?</i>”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ne crains rien, ma petite soeur. Aie foi! La justice
du bon Dieu se fera.</i> General von Holwitz&mdash;are you
ready?”</p>

<p>“I am curious to know your plan. Is it murder?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, you forget that you are among Frenchmen,”
he said, looking down at him. “I have no further
explanations to make to you. Père Glorieux, you will inform
Mademoiselle de Saint Omer.”</p>

<p>None of us noticed the slip until afterwards. Von
Holwitz flushed under the rebuke, shrugged his shoulders,
and then turned to Bernoline.</p>

<p>“I do not imagine that you contemplate claiming my
name for my son.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>

<p>He waited. No one answered him.</p>

<p>“If you should wish a written attestation, I shall be
glad to give it. That was all I wanted to say. Père
Glorieux,”&mdash;he drew out his pocketbook and handed it
to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i>,&mdash;“you will find here the address of my
mother. The rest&mdash;for the necessary masses. Ready,
now.”</p>

<p>He turned and, with the spirit of bravado that remained
to the end, his heels clicked and his hand came to salute.</p>

<p>“Ahead of me&mdash;and walk as I direct you,” said de
Saint Omer’s stern voice. “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bernoline, ma petite soeur,
prie pour ton frère.</i>”</p>

<p>The last I saw of Von Holwitz was the eternal red and
white handkerchief pressed to his cheek,&mdash;a man who
was going to his death, annoyed at a scratch! They
passed and the voice of Père Glorieux cried out,</p>

<p>“Pray for the souls of both of them!”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>What happened I have never been able to see quite
clearly. They went down the main street, twenty paces
between them, and straight to the murderous intersection
at the Square. What was the idea in the mediaeval
imagination of De Saint Omer; the judgment of God, as
by some trial of fire; or, if that failed him, a resort to
the duel? I don’t know. Strange as it may seem, it is
a question I have never asked. I couldn’t. The past between
us two is something buried and protected by the
granite weight of suffering. At any rate, it ended there
in the Square. Thank God for that!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We had been on our knees&mdash;I don’t know how long&mdash;Bernoline
and I, shoulder to shoulder,&mdash;praying from
the bottom of our hearts when De Saint Omer returned.
I saw him coming and leaned towards her.</p>

<p>“Safe!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>

<p>She closed her eyes, and her head dropped on my
shoulder. The next moment, the brother was beside her,
kneeling.</p>

<p>“Your prayers were heard, little saint. And God has
done justice.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I left them alone and went outside and sat on a toppled
stone. Heavens, how benign and innocent that afternoon
was, clear blue with powdery clouds above, the young
green stealing along a sheltered bush, the shrill piping
of a nesting bird somewhere,&mdash;a note that pierced
through the shattering iteration of the bombardment and
down into my brain. It terrified me, that insistent eternal
cry of reborn nature that recked neither our sorrows nor
our human passing.</p>

<p>Père Glorieux came out presently, drew off his surplice,
ranged his communion service, packed it into a box and
opened his knapsack. I watched him. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Poilu</i> once more,
gun at attention, he stood awaiting orders, a bronzed,
bearded face that had looked into death and heard the
laments of a thousand souls.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“David, mon frère!”</i></p>

<p>I rose, seeing nothing. De Saint Omer came to me and
took my hand in his quick, vibrating grip.</p>

<p>“From now on, we are brothers. It is a solemn promise,”
he said, looking into my eyes. “And now, David,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon frère</i>, there is only one person to be thought of,&mdash;Bernoline.
You will give her the courage she needs. I
know her decision. It is the only one. We are an old
race, and, when we see our duty, we never hesitate. Come
to me afterwards.” He opened his arms and took me
into them in a long embrace. Then he turned to his
sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span></p>

<p>“It is good-by until&mdash;” He raised his finger to the
calm serenity above. “Sister, your blessing.”</p>

<p>He dropped to one knee. She laid her hands on his
forehead and her lips moved silently. Then he rose and
went hurriedly out. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i> turned and went to join
Marianne and the child. I was alone with Bernoline.</p>

<p>“Good God! If a shell would only end it all!”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon ami</i>, that is why death is not the hardest.”</p>

<p>I held out my arms. She came to them, her eyes looked
into mine, our lips came together, and that first kiss,
which was our last, was given with our mingled tears.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I did not attempt to struggle against our fate. I knew
it was hopeless. She did not move; nor did her arms relax
their straining tension while time went by us unheeded,
<span class="locked">until&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I love you, David <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon adoré</i>. I have always loved
you, with all my being,” she said, looking into my eyes.</p>

<p>“Bernoline, I would marry you now, to-day. I could
go with you anywhere, into any life&mdash;you and your child&mdash;nothing
can matter,” I said brokenly.</p>

<p>“I know.” She tried to smile and couldn’t. “Thank
you, dear, for not making it harder. And now come.”</p>

<p>She held out her hand and, taking it, I followed her
blindly.</p>

<p>All that I remember is my standing there in the swept
garden of the convent, is seeing her take the child from
the nurse and raise it to her shoulder. Thus bearing her
cross, she went out of my life forever.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>All the rest is only numbed pain and incomprehension,&mdash;weeks
and months. To-day I am alive, and the world
has somehow come back to me. How, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Now that I have written it down, I feel as though something
had changed in me. Our sorrows destroy us, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
themselves. Somewhere before, I remember writing that.
Something is gone in me that the rest may struggle up
and go on.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>VII</h3>

<p>There is little more to add, only two letters,&mdash;one
from Bernoline and one from Anne, without whom I
would not be here to-day. They came to me, worn and
postmarked, a week before we went into the final struggles
of July, and through those final months of hurricane and
tireless slaughter I carried them over my heart&mdash;together.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">David:</p>

<p>I write this last letter to you. Would that I had never
crossed your path, to bring the unhappiness that I have
brought into your life. I write this to you as the final and
supreme proof of my love, of all that I would have given you
every hour of the year, had God willed it. It is of Anne that
I write.</p>

<p>I went to her at B&mdash;&mdash;, where she is stationed, and told her
all, though much she had guessed. David, she is no longer
the girl, untried and undisciplined. She is a woman that you
will be proud of as your wife, when the time comes, and the
ache and pain have passed. There is a bigness in her soul,
something deep and honest&mdash;and she loves you. She has
always loved you and, what is wonderful in a woman’s heart&mdash;she
understands. There will never be anything petty or
unworthy of a great nature. She loves you, David; how much,
how beautifully; with what a maternal affection you can never
guess. And you need this protecting love. If you could have
been present, have seen the look in her eyes, her simplicity
and her dignity, when I asked her to be your strength, to
watch over you these months!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span></p>

<p>“I love him,” she said. “I have never really loved any one
else, and I took a vow long ago that if I could not belong to
him, I would never marry any other man.”</p>

<p>Perhaps I have no right to tell you this, but in this moment
I think you should know. Do not turn from her, David. It
is a treasure that awaits you.</p>

<p>I have thought of you ever since I left you; I think of you
every moment of my hours in the little chapel that alone brings
me some strength, and I have seen far ahead of the pain of
the present. I would that I could take into my heart all that
I cannot keep you from suffering, that you must suffer for a
while for having come into my sad life. Yes, David, it will
be hard&mdash;readjustment is hard&mdash;it is sometimes so much
easier to go on, no matter what we have to bear. But you
will come out of this period of trial. You will come out superbly.
Happiness will be waiting for you; do not delay too
long. For, dear friend, you are one of those who need happiness
in your life. All this period of unrest and indecision
which so often has depressed you and shaken your confidence
will give you a bigger vision and a surer charity, when once
life is stable and calm. And, David, that will come; I know
it&mdash;I feel it so strangely. I do see ahead, and I think this
power is given me as some consolation for what I must bear.</p>

<p>Don’t let your mind dwell too much on me. I have my
faith, David, and I can accept anything. Sacrifice must fall
on all equally in this terrible trial. I am only one of a million
women,&mdash;remember that!</p>

<p>And now, it must be good-bye&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ah, mon bien aimé</i>, how
hard it is to write. I feel as though thy hand were in my
hand and that I were clinging to it, unable to let it go. I do
not ask thee to forget me. Remember me only to help thee.
Be strong&mdash;be true to yourself&mdash;accept life nobly. Your
country is a great country; men like you are needed. Be what
you can, whether it be big or little, to give it leadership. Suffering
we cannot avoid, mon ami, but unselfish achievement
is alone lasting satisfaction. Davy, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon bien aimé</i>, aim high,
for your own sake&mdash;and for the peace of soul of one who
night and day will keep you both in her prayers.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Bernoline.</span>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">David:</p>

<p>Bernoline has been here, and told me, and oh, my heart
goes out to you. You will need to know that you are not alone
in this world, that there is some one who shares your sorrow
and holds you dear. Will you let me be all that to you&mdash;just
for the present. Will you let me give you just a little of
the great love that you are denied, and let me tell you that
in friendship or otherwise, as it may come to you, I am always
at your side. I don’t know how I find the courage to
write you thus. I know you will respect it. We are not children,
dear. We are man and woman, and we both know suffering.
If I thought only of myself, I would never send this
letter. But we live in the midst of death, when little things
fade away, and at the thought of your utter loneliness, David,
dear, I think of nothing else but the love you need, and I can
do no less after having known Bernoline.</p>

<p>David, she is not of this world. I shall always love her as
you love her, as a peasant kneels and adores an ideal among
the shadows and the candles. She has a strength that is not
my strength, a faith that I envy but cannot find. I went with
her to the little chapel of St. Anne, and knelt while she prayed.
If you could have seen her face! I thought it was not the
sculptured calm of the Madonna enshrined in heaven but the
serenity in her worn eyes that was the miracle. A little saint,
David, has crossed our paths and we must be true to the
memory. Let me help you, David, dear.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>A week has gone since I started these final pages. I
have been amazed at the feeling of detachment that has
come to me. Bernoline and Maurice have often spoken to
me of that state of grace which in their faith lifts men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
and women above the earth to seek heaven. I have seen
this same unhuman state of grace, of sanctified sacrifice,
among officers and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilus</i> during the war,&mdash;the need to
live in some rarefied atmosphere. Family and friends
recede before the proud isolation of the soul dedicated to
a sacrificial death. It is not quite that with me. Yet
there has come with the final writing a serenity that surprises
me. Is it that I have suffered beyond my capacity&mdash;for
each of us has in him only a certain capacity to
suffer&mdash;or is it life in its strange compensations that is
molding me? To-day, for the first time, I can recall
Bernoline and feel a quiet happiness to have been privileged
to know her. Until now I have felt only my bondage
to the past. To-day&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noblesse oblige</i>&mdash;I want to
live, and count in the living. The bitterness and the rebellion
are gone; an inspiration remains.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In this new liberation, Anne, too, counts for much. I
have seen her three times,&mdash;once in a week’s <i>permission</i>
we were together every day. Twice a week her letters
come to me. It is strange how Bernoline has brought us
together. We both feel it. There is a great moral force
in love, and against its silent, cumulative movement the
meanness and littleness of life must yield. As Bernoline,
in her faith, wished to see us, we shall become.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There is beyond the inherent nobility that is in Anne
a largeness of spirit that is hard for a man to understand.
She reveres the memory of Bernoline and in her great
heart there is no trace of jealousy. At least, if there is,
it is wonderful how she conceals it. That is a quality
which I do not think would be in me. I can look ahead&mdash;we
both can&mdash;and see what is coming; yet until every
corner of my heart is wholly and loyally hers, I cannot
offer it to her. To do so would be to offend what is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
one thing to build on,&mdash;absolute honesty between us,
that brings the deepest reverence.&mdash;Yet, to-day, I know
the time is near.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We both feel the call to service and often have discussed
where we may fit in to do our little part. For a
life that is closed in about our own self-centered enjoyment
is now impossible. We see the failure of our generation,&mdash;its
failure to rise to its opportunities and responsibilities,
its consequent weakening and approaching
impotence and the inevitable surging up from beneath of
another more virile force; the substitution of a natural
for an artificial power (as Alan would have said). It
<i>is</i> a challenge.</p>

<p>Once, when we were discussing this, Anne said to me
a very searching thing.</p>

<p>“David, our kind hasn’t even the instinct of self-preservation.”</p>

<p>True&mdash;but if we haven’t we shall have to yield, as we
should yield.</p>

<p>Anne constantly surprises me. I find in her such an
eager outlook on life,&mdash;a longing to read, to explore, to
question, to find an illuminating purpose for living. Her
mind, as it awakens, leads mine on, and I react to its
stimulus.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I have no illusion about myself. The part I may be
called on to play is but a little part in the progress of my
country. Yet, there must be thousands of us&mdash;quiet,
patient lieutenants&mdash;to make possible the coming of a
real leader.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I think I understand better now the mystery of good
and evil, the thought that has run all through these pages,&mdash;often
groping, turned back on itself, and often in seeming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
contradiction. Sometimes out of evil there comes a
healthy reaction, but the moral quality of an act remains,
much as we should like to believe otherwise. Temptations,
the great salient temptations that determine a life,
are as rare as opportunities. They are opportunities to be
met and dominated. Neither Letty nor any of her kind
can to-day even for a moment swerve me from my clear
perception of values. That, at least, I know. Yet, in my
memory that will always be a tithe to be paid. I have
won a certain mastery,&mdash;but a scar will abide.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The mystery of good and the pain that from a pure
source may often destroy a life is this. In each of us is
the choice between rebellion and acceptance of life; in
each is the reaching out beyond our designated paths,
towards a love that has the romance, the mystery and the
wonder of life, that we know is forbidden us. Even so
in the Garden of Eden, the fruit of the tree of knowledge
was forbidden. The other is facing actuality, founding
our lives on a logical, practical companionship, and growing
into unity through mutual respect and the test of
experience. To different natures, different answers.
Rebel against life and destroy ourselves with a beating of
the wings against the bars of circumstance,&mdash;or meet
it with a deliberate, difficult acceptance? Which, I wonder,
is the more fortunate nature? But for those who
have a tiny, latent spark hidden away under layers of
bread-and-butter years&mdash;an uneasy stirring of remembered
dreams&mdash;youth, too often, must be burned out,
like a fever.</p>
